    "text": "Task 1: Mapping marine scientific research on MGR of ABNJ\n\nPublications and funding: Marine Biodiversity – General Overview\nInformation considering 116 million records belonging to marine, brackish, freshwater, or terrestrial environments was compiled. Further analysis revealed that there are 153,810 “marine only” organisms recorded, predominantly at the species level (134,185), with fewer recorded at the genus (14,592) and family (1,902) levels.\nA detailed examination of the ‘marine only’ dataset from the taxonomic perspective highlights the predominance of the kingdom Animalia, particularly emphasizing mollusks and arthropods. Further, some of the most mentioned species in the literature on MGR are: the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the seagrass species Posidonia oceanica and the unicellular alga Dunaliella salina, the edible sea lettuce Ulva lactuca, and Cenarchaeum symbiosum, which has a symbiotic relationship with marine sponges. Viruses are under-represented, with only a couple listed, including the economically significant White Spot Syndrome Virus. Protozoa like Centropyxis aculeata and Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, although less frequent, were also detected as a part of the study.\nExamination of historical trends demonstrates a discernible increase in the number of publications starting from the early 20th century, with a significant surge occurring from around the 1960s onwards. Analysis of the disciplines attached to the highest number of publications presented biology and ecology as the dominating fields, an expected ranking given their direct relevance to marine biodiversity. Applied sciences like fisheries, genetics, and biochemistry follow closely behind. Regarding geographical relevance, the data on publication numbers by UN regions highlights the Americas and Europe as the top contributors, each accounting for approximately 33% of the total publications. Together, these regions constitute nearly two-thirds of the global output, indicating a significant concentration of scholarly activity. Asia follows closely behind with 25% of the total publications, while Oceania and Africa contribute smaller fractions, representing 6% and 3% respectively.\nThe United States, China, and Japan lead in publication counts, indicating significant investment and interest in marine biodiversity research. European countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France also contribute substantially. The French National Centre for Scientific Research stands out at as the top institution, however, is closely followed by The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ocean University of China in the top three rankings, highlighting China’s investment in research. This is further supported by China’s lead in marine research funding followed by the United States, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the European Union, highlighting significant investment in marine research by these countries. Only 11.6% of publications within the marine dataset mention funding information, indicating a low level of transparency in research funding. Funding disclosure in marine biodiversity publications has shown a gradual increase since the early 1990s, peaking in 2016, but displaying some fluctuations thereafter.\nIn relation to the commercial aspect, analysis of the scientific literature shows that there is clear evidence, albeit at a low level, of commercial research on ABNJ organisms in the scientific literature. This is particularly in respect to the genetic and chemical properties of organisms. However, commercially focused research appears to constitute a small part of the wider research effort. In reality, applied research is presently a subset of research activity in ABNJ.\n\n\nPublications: Marine biodiversity from ABNJ\nThe interim working definition of ABNJ demonstrates a difficulty in discriminating with certainty between research conducted in ABNJ and work conducted inside the EEZ. As such, a methodology was developed to incorporate weighted criteria within the scope of the working definition of ABNJ to mediate this challenge. This weighted scoring system serves to assess the likelihood that organisms or features are located within ABNJ. Weighted parameters include underwater features, ocean names, and depth criteria. For example, an organism that is recorded exclusively in ABNJ is assigned a higher probability score than those found in multiple environments. The sum of all of these criteria then allows species to be sorted by level. For the purpose of this summary, priority is given to the higher levels (4 & 6), as those are more likely to incorporate exclusivity for ABNJ.\n\n\nLikely from ABNJ (Level 4)\nIn the present study, 5.5% of the entire marine dataset analyzed is classified as “Level 4.” Among the most researched species at this level are North Atlantic-dwelling copepod Calanus finmarchicus, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, red seabream Pagrus major as a commercially important fish species, the Norwegian lobster Nephrops norvegicus and Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus.While biology and ecology remain the leading disciplines, zoology, geology and oceanography also emerge at the top. The continuous prominence of terms related to fisheries indicates an enduring focus on this area within marine research.\nAlthough country-specific patterns align with the general marine dataset above, as the scope of the dataset is narrowed within this section from the broader marine biodiversity search, China’s prominence decreases. Institutions like the University of Tokyo (Japan), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (USA), University of Bergen (Norway), and University of Washington (USA) rise in rankings, indicating a shift in research prominence (Fig. 1). Additionally, the United Nations regions’ analysis shows Europe surpassing the USA, as research focus narrows to ABNJ, evidenced by a higher publication share.\n\n\nVery Likely from ABNJ (Level 6)\nLevel 6, which accounts for a mere 0.3% of the overall marine dataset analyzed indicating low-level research activity as the likelihood of exclusivity to ABNJ increases. Within this level, taxonomic focus narrows to specific species, including Antarctic krill, blind shrimp like Rimicarisexoculata, the mollusc Bathymodiolus azoricus, and the polychaete worm Alvinella pompejana. Other notable organisms include the abyssal grenadier fish Coryphaenoides armatus and the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Research publications peaked in 2008 with 61 articles, with a notable increase in mentions of concepts related to hydrothermal circulation and vent systems. France has further secured its position as a significant contributor, with institutions like IFREMER and the French National Centre for Scientific Research leading in publication output (Fig. 1). The US maintains a strong presence, while Europe’s share of activity is on the rise (Fig. 2). Overall, Level 6 marks a transition to more specialized research, with distinct patterns in publication activity and research focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Marine Biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 6\n\n\nFigure 1.

Regional Share of Publications at Increasingly Narrow Scope\n\n\nGeographical distribution\nOne of the weighted criteria applied focused on geographical distribution, as our study mapped ABNJ MGR research both vertically (depth) and horizontally (features). This distribution links research data to ABNJ-specific locations and named underwater locations, such as seamounts and hydrothermal vents. The analysis reveals 7,204 publications for marine organisms involving 607 underwater places either in the EEZ or ABNJ. Of these, 89 underwater places were identified as ABNJ-alone involving 2,491 publications.\n\n\nCollaboration networks\nMarine scientific research often encompasses collaboration among researchers from various organizations and countries, and mapping these collaborations helps visualize the dominant actors within the marine research landscape. The present work presents three types of interactive collaboration networks, focusing on: 1) Institutions, 2) Countries, and 3) Funding. Notable observations highlight that collaborations between Low-Income and High-Income countries are prevalent, whereas partnerships among Low-Income countries are rare (see for instance Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of a network analysis of collaborations (with Madagascar)",

    "text": "Task 2: Analyzing the market value and commercialization potential of MGR of ABNJ through scientific and patent assessments\n\nPatent landscape and market\nThe analysis encompassing organisms tagged as “marine” in Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) identified 4,903 organisms within patent data, linked to 53,768 first patent filings from 1990 to 2021, revealing an increasing trend (Fig. 4). One notable influencing aspect of the patent landscape analysis is the geographic distribution of patent activities, with a strong presence in developed countries (the US remains at the very top, followed by the European Patent Office) and emerging contributions from nations like China.\nThe primary areas of patent activity include biotechnology and genetic engineering, peptides, genetically engineered plants, fermentation, measuring and testing processes, biocides, foods, and cosmetics. Major applicants include large agricultural companies such as Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Monsanto, BASF, and Bayer Cropscience, enzyme producers like Novozymes (now Novensis), and universities such as the University of California. Geographically, the majority of filings occurred in the United States, followed by the European Patent Office, Japan, and other developed countries. Over 50% of filings in major markets such as the United States originated from non-residents, indicating a global interest in seeking patent protection in these regions.\nA focused filter on marine-only organisms showed 534 filings in 2017, with a potential decline afterwards, suggesting shifts in country rankings and applicants (Fig. 4). When analyzing species recorded in ABNJ in OBIS that can be found in other locations as well, the activity was found to be less than 500 filings per year and concentrated in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. This narrowed scope fostered a significant change in applicant rankings, exemplified by Novozymes experiencing a sharp decline in their position based on initial filings. Conversely, Bayer Cropscience ascended to the top ranking, followed by Syngenta Participations in second place, while the University of California consistently maintained its third position, unaffected by the filtering criteria.\nA third and narrower filter, analyzing patents involving marine organisms that may exist only in ABNJ showed that patent filing activity was typically under 150 filings per year (Fig. 4). Interestingly, narrowed focus again resulted in a shift concerning applicant rankings, with different subsidiaries of BayerAG taking over the top. Pioner Hi-Bred International is also present among the top 5, whilst University of California ranking sinks down to the 5th position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine Organisms Mentioned\n\n\n\n\n\nABNJ Recorded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABNJ Exclusive\n\n\nFigure 4: First Filing of Patent Families with Narrowing Scope\nWith respect to the patent analysis, there are growing references to marine organisms in patent data, as well as to organisms recorded in ABNJ. In a small number of cases, notably Calanus finmarchius as well as the enzymes from Thermococcus 9N, there is evidence of the intent to commercialize explicitly from ABNJ. However, the outputs of this search reiterate the concept that the existence of a patent family does not equate to the existence of a product on the market. Overall, definitive evidence for the collection of organisms from ABNJ that later appear in patent documents remains low in the overall landscape.",

    "text": "Task 3: Proposing regulatory frameworks for the equitable distribution of monetary benefits derived from MGR of ABNJ utilization\n\nIdentification of MGR based products that could have come from ABNJ\nIn Tasks 1 and 2, extensive big data analyses were conducted to understand the current state of play regarding the valorisation of MGR of ABNJ. This involved examining scientific research activities and intellectual property developments related to these resources, resulting in insights into the commercial potential and existing patent landscape. The primary aim of Task 3 was to explore and evaluate different regulatory options for monetary benefit-sharing mechanisms associated with MGR of ABNJ, addressing a key aspect of the BBNJ treaty negotiations, and use the input from tasks 1 and 2 to assess the current state of actual valorisation of MGR of ABNJ.\nSeveral methods were applied to identify if there are currently any products on the market that are derived from MGR of ABNJ: the literature search and patent search from tasks 1&2, a novel method using an AI tool to search a copy of the entire internet (the ‘common crawl’) and manual confirmation of all possible leads. This exercise turned out to be very complex, due to several challenges. First of all, in most cases of historic R&D it is not possible to say with certainty if the target organism was indeed coming from ABNJ or not, as there is no information of the location of the first sample used for the R&D. Therefore, all results, apart from one, in this study should be interpreted as could have come from ABNJ: as a matter of transparency all the products based on MGR that could have originated from ABNJ have been included in the study, even when the likelihood is low according to the available data, and this is specified where possible. A global search also comes with language challenges, which results in a bias in the results towards products that have associated publications in English. When searching for product revenue, companies have no legal obligation to disclose this information. It is therefore impossible to make an accurate assessment of how much the current MGR products on the market generate in yearly revenue, so rough estimations are used.1\nIt is argued that the introduction of the BBNJ Batch Identifier will play a key role in future assessment of MGR of ABNJ valorisation. The Batch Identifier, in combination with the new WIPO disclosure of origin requirement2 for patent applications, should guarantee that any future product developed from an MGR of ABNJ will be properly documented and reported.\nThe search for potential MGR products on the market identified nine organisms linked to 74 products that are developed based on MGR that could have come from ABNJ. The total combined estimated revenue of these products is between $400 and $650 million per year, though it is for now impossible to assess with any certainty whether this revenue can be attributed to ABNJ or not. Out of those 74 products, only 1, can be attributed to an MGR of ABNJ with 100% certainty (i.e. the R&D was conducted on an organism collected from a known location in ABNJ and the MGR is fundamental to the product). To the best of our knowledge, none of these products were the result of the use of digital sequence information (DSI) only.\n\n\nRegulatory frameworks for benefit-sharing: analysis and monetary benefit-sharing estimations\nTask 3 presents a comprehensive analysis of regulatory options for monetary benefit-sharing associated with MGR of ABNJ. Building upon previous tasks that analysed the current state of MGR valorisation, this task delves into the complex issue of ensuring fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from MGR. The study identifies and evaluates different monetary benefit-sharing mechanisms, aiming to provide substantive support for future negotiations at the BBNJ Conference of the Parties (COP).\nThe analysis identified several potential monetary benefit-sharing modalities, which were divided into coupled and decoupled options. Coupled options, where benefits are directly linked to the financial success of commercialized products, include royalties on sales, milestone payments, profit sharing, and licensing fees. Decoupled options, where benefits are not directly tied to the success of utilization, include fixed access fees, annual licensing fees, flat contribution mechanisms, subscription models, membership fees, and a micro-levy on proxy parameters like equipment or vessel usage.\nUsing a decision matrix based on different sets of criteria, a decision was made to focus further work on milestone payments, revenue-based payments, a decoupled fee-based system, and a potential micro-levy. The first two options are explicitly listed in Article 14.7 of the BBNJ treaty, while decoupled options were selected based on their feasibility and potential for broad applicability and sustainability. The integration of a tiered fee structure was also considered to tailor financial contributions to reflect varying capacities and impacts of different users, ensuring a fair and balanced system.\nThe analysis of coupled payment options for monetary benefit-sharing of MGR of ABNJ revealed both potential revenue and significant challenges. Revenue-based payments and milestone payments were identified as possible mechanisms; however, their effectiveness is contingent on the commercial success of MGR-derived products. Applying a 1% revenue-based payment to the estimated market value of $400 million could generate approximately $4 million annually, and up to $6.5 million at the higher market value estimate of $650 million per year. It is important to note that this revenue (1) is linked to products using MGR that could have come from ABNJ and (2) are the result of past utilization, and therefore potentially outside the scope3 of the BBNJ Treaty.\nDespite their potential, these coupled payment mechanisms pose challenges, including the need for robust tracking and administrative systems to monitor financial flows and ensure compliance. This requirement could impose substantial burdens on users and regulators, complicating implementation and management. Additionally, the variable nature of commercial success in the biotechnology sector could result in unpredictable revenue streams, potentially undermining the stability and reliability of the benefit-sharing fund. We also highlighted that milestone payments would only realistically be possible for pharmaceutical products and would come with significant downsides. Finally, the current international and national financial reporting obligations do not offer the tools to identify revenue at product level.\nThe evaluation of decoupled payment options for monetary benefit-sharing highlighted the flexibility and predictability these mechanisms offer. Fixed annual fees, for instance in the shape of an annual licensing fee or membership fee, could distribute the financial burden across a broader user base. For example, using publication and patent data as proxies to identify who has research and commercial interests in MGR of ABNJ respectively, a decoupled fee system could generate between $4 and $6 million USD per year. We did not find a suitable way to implement a micro-levy.\nDecoupled mechanisms also present challenges. While they could provide a steady revenue stream, they may not fully capture the value from high-profit activities, potentially leading to fairness issues. Furthermore, these mechanisms require careful calibration to ensure they are equitable and do not disproportionately impact certain users and thus hamper R&D. The predictability and broader participation of decoupled payments make them attractive, but their implementation must be carefully designed to balance equity and effectiveness. The BBNJ batch identifier could help with more reliably determining the non-commercial and commercial actors active in the MGR of ABNJ space",

    "text": "The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) initiated discussions on an international legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in ABNJ in 2017, leading to the launch of intergovernmental negotiations in 2018. These negotiations culminated in the approval of the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) treaty in 2023, which addresses a package of elements, including marine genetic resources (MGR) with a focus on benefit-sharing, area-based management tools, environmental impact assessments, and capacity building and technology transfer. Among these, the issue of MGR in ABNJ has generated significant interest and debate. Despite this, the commercial value of these resources remains uncertain. Between 2006 and 2013, the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group on marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction repeatedly highlighted the need for more research to assess the economic value of MGR in ABNJ to inform decision-making. However, to date, only one comprehensive study has been conducted — in 2014.\nThe main objective of this study is to provide evidence-based information and analysis on the actual and potential market value of marine genetic resources (MGR) from areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). This aims to support the implementation of the legally binding BBNJ agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. Building upon previous investigations, this study focused on three specific objectives: 1) mapping recent and planned marine scientific research activities exploring MGR in ABNJ, 2) analyzing the market value and commercialization of MGR from ABNJ through a scientific and patent landscape analysis, and 3) proposing regulatory options for the sharing of monetary benefits derived from the utilization of MGR in ABNJ.\nThis lack of extensive assessment on the commercial value and market scale of MGR in ABNJ has led to divergent narratives about its potential. Developing countries advocated for monetary benefit-sharing mechanisms, while developed countries expressed concerns about the costs associated with monitoring and implementing such systems. Understanding the actual and potential market value and commercialization of MGR in ABNJ is therefore crucial to shaping and implementing an efficient and equitable benefit-sharing framework.\nThis project was conducted by a consortium led by ABS International, with the support of One World Analytics and the University of Aberdeen. The methodology employed builds on the earlier work conducted in 2014, which was carried out by the One World Analytics team.",

    "section": "Research on Marine Biodiversity",
    "text": "Research on Marine Biodiversity\nFor the purposes of this research, we assume that published research on marine biodiversity typically references organisms using either taxonomic names or common (vernacular) names. The Biodiversity Graph is a citation graph of the scientific literature. Thus, it is well-suited to offer an overview of research on marine biodiversity. It is built upon publications that reference taxonomic names and the ensuing citation networks derived from those publications.\nA key issue highlighted in the 2014 report ‘Valuing the Deep’and subsequent research is the challenge of identifying which organisms occur solely in marine environments, which are found in both marine and other environments, and which organisms are not marine at all. Recent innovations at OBIS,1 based on contributions from the WoRMS database,2 introduce fields identifying whether an organism among the 116 million records is found in marine, brackish, freshwater, or terrestrial environments. Table 1 provides a summary of this data. Using these indicators, we can estimate the number of organisms by rank that, according to OBIS data, are exclusively observed in the marine environment or are ‘marine only’ as they will be described below. As we will see, while this categorisation is far from perfect, it is useful for the purposes of the present study.\nTable 1: Marine Organisms in OBIS by Taxonomic Rank and Habitat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to emphasise that classifying an organism as “marine only” based on the available data in OBIS does not necessarily mean that the organism is exclusively found in marine environments. Instead, this calculated measure aids in excluding a significant number of organisms known to inhabit non-marine environments, thus refining the scope of the analysis. Furthermore, higher-order taxonomic ranks—such as phyla, families, and genera—are more likely to encompass organisms found in multiple environments. As a result, we cite these for illustration but centre our analysis on the species level. For our purposes, the species level refers solely to a binomial taxonomic name. It does not incorporate details like the taxonomic authority. This is largely because many works outside the taxonomic community use binomials and often omit details such as the taxonomic authority (the name of the individual or individuals who first validly published the name). Those familiar with the NCBI taxonomy may encounter some variation from their expectations as while it is widely used, it lacks taxonomic authority.\nThe Biodiversity Graph represents a relatively new method of recording biodiversity records, though citation graphs are well established in the scientometric and bibliometric literature. Within the biodiversity community, the citation graph-based approach is gaining in popularity, with taxonomists aiming to highlight the contributions of taxonomic specialists to the broader biodiversity-related scientific record.\nGiven the novelty of our citation graph, we decided to validate the 21 million records in the current graph against an independently constructed dataset for marine biodiversity. This was done using the original keyword-based Valuing the Deep dataset, which contains 17,434 DOIs, a 2014 reference set of 21,548 DOIs from the MarinLit database of marine natural product-related literature, and a dataset of 6,659 DOIs from the 2019 WIPO landscape study on marine genetic resources in South-East Asian (ASEAN) countries (Oldham, Shale, and Kindness (2019). Since these sets are now out of date, we retrieved the references and subsequent citing publications to build a dataset of 1,240,324 documents linked to the original sets. The metadata for these 1.2 million documents was obtained using the Lens Scholarly API, processed using the Humboldt NER model, and combined with the OBIS dataset of ‘marine only’ taxonomic names to create a marine reference graph,3 In total, this graph included 30,955 ‘marine only’ taxonomic names (all ranks) in 161,698 publications and 23,095 binomial species names in 113,050 publications.\nConversely, the Biodiversity Graph comprised 49,695 ‘marine only’ taxonomic names in 452,248 publications and 39,362 binomial names in 308,766 publications.4 The distinction between the marine reference graph and the Biodiversity Graph lies in their construction methods: the former was mainly assembled using searches for various marine-related terms (e.g., mud volcanoes in the Valuing the Deep study) and therefore mirrors the limitations of the initial parameters. The Biodiversity Graph, on the other hand, was designed to capture information on organisms by text mining published research literature for millions of taxonomic names and all their citations. Thus, as expected, the Biodiversity Graph would demonstrate broader coverage.\nAs these figures indicate, a substantial gap exists between the appearance of names in the taxonomic record and their presence in scientific publications available to researchers in digital datasets like OpenAlex. With the increasing digitization of taxonomic records, especially through initiatives such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library, we anticipate that coverage will continually improve.5 Enhancements in access to the full texts of scientific publications should further boost the capture of taxonomic names and their associated common or vernacular names. However, as detailed further below, our capability to spotlight research on biodiversity or any other subject is limited by the availability of digital data and our access to it.\nThe decision to focus on ‘marine only’ species recorded in the existing OBIS data has certain collateral effects. One such effect is the omission of commercially significant species, such as the giant tiger prawn Penaeus monodon, a central focus of aquaculture in South-East Asia and beyond, from our dataset (Oldham, Shale, and Kindness (2019). While this exclusion narrows our dataset, it allows us to focus our analysis on organisms found solely in marine environments, with the aim of mapping the landscape of research and innovation involving marine genetic resources specifically from the High Seas.\nWith these caveats and observations in mind, we present a general summary of global research on marine biodiversity. As a starting point Figure 5 provides a general overview of the most common terms in the data, including taxonomic, common, habitat and place names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A summary of the number of publications and rankings of terms across labels for Taxonomic, Common, Habitat and Place Names.\nThe rankings in Figure 5 are generated by processing publication data with our Humboldt NER model to extract terms. This model is trained to recognise entities within taxonomic categories, which for our purposes included Species, Uninomials (including the genus, family, or higher order name), Common Names and Viruses, as well as place names and habitats. The training data for the habitat label was derived from a combination of a review of the European Environment Agency’s EUNIS habitat classification (2019 revision) and the real-world use of habitat-related terminology in texts. As an approach, term capture by deep-learning-based Named Entity Recognition models is superior to dictionary-based approaches, as these may fail to capture term variations, such as plurals and minor spelling variations, as observed in the raw data for Figure 5. However, models such as Humboldt NER are not perfect, and for our purposes a more specialised approach to certain labels, particularly place names, is required to identify entities which may not have been picked up by the model. It is also worth noting that data capture is confined to the available metadata for publications (e.g., titles, abstracts, author keywords, concept information, etc.) as opposed to the text of these publications themselves.\nWe will now explore our ‘marine only’ dataset in more detail. Figure 6 provides an overview of the top taxonomic entities deemed to be ‘marine only’. In approaching Figure 6, note that terms that are marked as ‘Not Known’ refer to taxonomic names that did not match to the GBIF taxonomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: A summary of the number of publications and rankings for marine only organisms, ranging from Kingdom to Phylum, Species and Uninomial Names.\nFigure 6 reveals, as we might expect, that the top rankings are for animals (Animalia). The data is dominated by molluscs (Mollusca) and arthropods (Arthropoda) such as crabs. The limitations of attempts to restrict results to organisms from specific environments are apparent when we consider the prominence of bacteria, notably members of Vibrio including Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of Cholera, which is not confined to marine environments. Other bacteria such as Shewanella putrefaciens are associated with iron and manganese reduction. Marine chromists are represented by diatoms such as Phaeodactylum tricornutum, for which reported uses have been found in biotechnology. A significant number of publications involve species with an unidentified Kingdom, arising from gaps in the GBIF taxonomy. An example would be the edible marine fungus Ecklonia cava. Among plants (Plantae) we observe a significant number of publications on the seagrass Posidonia oceanica and Dunaliella salina, a unicellular algae found in saline environments that is also sold as a supplement, while Ulval lactuca is an edible sea lettuce. For fungi we observe Trichoderma harzianum which appears to occur across multiple environments as does the halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii. Archaea are represented at low frequency by Thermoplasma acidophilum which again has been isolated in multiple environments and Cenarchaeum symbiosum which forms a symbiotic relationship with marine sponges. Viruses will be under-represented in this data because only two viruses are currently listed across OBIS, these include the commercially significant White Spot Syndrome Virus which has wide ranging impacts in aquaculture worldwide, notably in South-East Asian shrimp farms. Protozoa are represented at low frequency by Centropyxis aculeata and Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis.\nAs this brief discussion suggests, in practice while the focus has been significantly narrowed towards species only found in marine environments, we will still encounter species that occur in both marine and non-marine environments. Furthermore, these organisms may occur inside and outside the High Seas. Bearing in mind these considerations, challenges and caveats, we now direct our attention more specifically to the prevailing trends, central topics, and key players and main actors observed within the data.\n\nTrends, Topics and Actors\nFigure 7 provides an overview of trends, topics and country counts by number of publications and research institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Trends, Major Topics and Actors in the Marine Biodiversity Scientific Landscape\nIn examining Figure 7 it is apparent that the history of publication of research related to marine biodiversity extends to at least the early 20th Century. The analysis of trends in publications is affected by the availability of titles and abstracts in databases arising from copyright restrictions. Thus, the obvious dip in the data on trends reflects a gap in open access to abstract data.6 The ‘Concepts’ field pertains to article labels applied to publications in OpenAlex using the hierarchical open access Wikidata taxonomy. Predictably, the primary fields of study are biology and ecology. These are followed by applied topics such as fishery, genetics and biochemistry. When considering major topics such as Geology, note that the criteria for inclusion in this marine biodiversity graph is that the publications must be related to marine organisms in some way. As such the data will not capture all geological research or, as we see further down in the ‘Concepts’ panel of Figure 7, all publications in overarching disciplines such as Oceanography.\nCountry rankings and affiliation data are inherently incomplete. This is because this information may not be captured in the metadata of scientific publications, or it may not be recorded in the first place. This inherent limitation may skew our perception of research activity, as we are working with a dataset that, by its nature, is and will remain incomplete. Since data access has improved recently, newer data is more likely to be complete. Nevertheless, overall rankings will be affected by the lack of availability of affiliation data. When interpreting affiliation rankings, the presence of aggregate organisations should also be noted, such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Such organisations may be comprised of institutions which commonly act separately from one another. Conversely, some entities, while listed individually, might be part of broader institutions, resulting in comparisons that aren’t directly analogous. Furthermore, variations in entity naming add another layer of complexity. For instance, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration might be denoted as NOAA or other name variants, resulting in treatment as separate entities in the rankings.\nAs a result, these statistics, while informative, should not be considered definitive. Absent or incomplete affiliation data, coupled with the difficulty of handling variations of the same name (often referred to as the ‘names game’) is a significant concern for institutions and, in particular, for research funding organisations in evaluating the outcomes of their investments. To address these challenges, initiatives such as the open Research Organizations Registry (ROR) aim to provide harmonised data on organisations and funding bodies. Important initiatives such as ROR increasingly allow us to map global research activity as illustrated in Figure 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: This figure uses Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifiers with affiliation data to render a global map of activity. The map will not cover all institutions and may contain inaccurate coordinates\nFigure 8 demonstrates that the publication of research on marine biodiversity is now widely distributed around the world with discernible hot-spots of activity in all major world regions, with hubs of activity present in the United States, Western Europe and East Asia.\nMarine scientific research frequently involves networks of collaboration between researchers based in different organisations and different countries. The promotion of international partnerships and collaboration is a common priority for research organisations. Mapping these collaborations allows us to visualise networks of dominant actors within marine research, as shown in Figure 9.\n\nnew_inst = await FileAttachment(\"data/inst_network_june.json\").json();\n\ninst_code = function() {\n    var [option,myChart]=this.getVars()\n    var option;\n\n    myChart.showLoading();\n\n    var graph = new_inst;\n    \n     if (!graph || !graph.nodes || !graph.links || !graph.categories) {\n        console.error(\"Graph data is missing or malformed\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    myChart.hideLoading();\n\n    graph.nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n        node.label = {\n            show: node.symbolSize &gt; 16\n        };\n    });\n\n    option = {\n        tooltip: {},\n        legend: {\n    selectedMode: false,//'multiple',\n    // hoverLink: false,\n    data: graph.categories.filter(function(a) {\n        return [\"AU\", \"CN\", \"FR\", \"Japan\", \"GB\", \"US\"  ].includes(a.name);\n    }).map(function(a) {\n        return a.name;\n    }),\n    left: 'left'\n},\n        animation: false,\n        series: [{\n            name: 'Institution',\n            type: 'graph',\n            layout: 'force',\n            data: graph.nodes,\n            links: graph.links,\n            categories: graph.categories,\n            roam: true,\n            scaleLimit: {\n            min: 0.8, // minimum zoom level (0.5 means the chart can be zoomed out to half its original size)\n            max: 3   // maximum zoom level (2 means the chart can be zoomed in to twice its original size)\n            },\n            zoom: 1,\n            label: {\n                position: 'right',\n                formatter: '{b}',\n                opacity: 1,\n                backgroundColor: '#fff', \n                borderColor: '#fff',  // Add border to labels\n                borderWidth: 3  // Set border width\n                    //          rich: {\n                //    a: {\n                 //       backgroundColor: '#fff',\n                ////        borderColor: '#fff',\n                 //       borderWidth: 0.9,\n                   //     borderRadius: 5,  // Set border radius for rounded corners\n                     //   padding: [2, 4]  // Add padding to labels\n                //    }\n                //}\n            },\n            labelLayout: {\n            hideOverlap: true\n            },\n            lineStyle: {\n                color: 'source',\n                curveness: 0.3, \n                opacity: 0.1\n            },\n            force: {\n              repulsion: [600, 1200],\n              edgeLength: [200, 600]\n            },\n            emphasis: {\n                focus: 'adjacency',\n                lineStyle: {\n                    width: 10\n                },\n                 itemStyle: {\n        opacity: 1\n                 },\n            }\n        }]\n    };\n\n    option && myChart.setOption(option);\n\n}\n\nnew EchartsRunner()\n  .addCodes(inst_code)\n  .show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The academic collaboration network of institutions publishing research on marine biodiversity\nThis snapshot displays institutions that have published 1,000 or more scientific papers relating to marine biodiversity. Nodes are sized based on the number of publications produced by each institution and edges (lines) between nodes indicate that authors from these institutions have collaborated on a publication containing reference to a marine species. The numbers in the visuals reflect the total number of publications on marine biodiversity research output by each institution.\nFigure 10 shows the collaboration network for the French National Centre for Scientific Research, the most prolific author in the dataset, with 45,128 instances of collaboration with other institutions and 9,472 papers published on marine biodiversity. Figure 11 illustrates the same for the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with 21,394 instances of collaboration with authors from other institutions and 6,545 total publications found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The academic collaboration network for the French National Centre for Scientific Research.\nThese networks of relations between researchers reflect underlying investments by countries into collaboration and the development of marine research capacity. Whether it is possible to identify levels of investment into research remains a topic of future research. However, it is possible to gain an insight into some of the key agencies involved in supporting deep-sea related research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: The academic collaboration network of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nTable 2 shows the top institutions ranked by number of publications on marine biodiversity, alongside the total collaborations, instances where authors from each institution have collaborated with authors from another institution.\nTable 2: Table of total publications by institution (top ranked for illustration)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries and Regions\nThe data presented above can be broken down by number of publications per country and by United Nations Statistical Division region and sub-region as set out in Figure 12. In the data we have, while the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are the most prolific publishing institutions, as seen in figures above, the United States is the largest publisher of marine research overall, indicating that publication on marine biodiversity in the United States is more dispersed amongst different institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Country rankings by number of publications for UN major regions and UN sub-regions\nAuthors often collaborate with authors in different institutions across the globe. It is possible to examine this international collaboration to create a picture of global marine biodiversity research relationships. Figure 13 spotlights this international collaboration, depicting the frequency with which authors from institutions in different countries collaborate on marine research publications. Only countries with at least 200 instances of collaboration are shown in the visualisation. Nodes are sized by the total number of collaborations with institutions from other countries. Countries have been colour coded by World Bank Income Classification. These networks may serve as an indicator of countries’ investments in international collaboration and marine research capacity development, alongside their willingness and, crucially, capacity to collaborate internationally.\n\ncountry = await FileAttachment(\"data/country_network_june.json\").json();\n\ncountry_code = function() {\n    var [option, myChart] = this.getVars();\n\n    myChart.showLoading();\n\n    var graph = country;\n\n    myChart.hideLoading();\n\n    graph.nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n        node.label = {\n            show: node.symbolSize &gt; 0\n        };\n    });\n\n    option = {\n        tooltip: {},\n        legend: [{\n            selectedMode: false, //'multiple',\n            data: graph.categories.map(function(a) {\n                return a.name;\n            })//,\n            //hoverLink: false\n        }],\n        animationDuration: 0,\n        animationEasingUpdate: 'quinticInOut',\n        series: [{\n            name: 'Countries',\n            type: 'graph',\n            layout: 'circular',\n            circular: {\n                rotateLabel: true\n            },\n            data: graph.nodes,\n            links: graph.links,\n            categories: [\n                {\n                    name: 'Low income',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#9400D3' //Dark Violet\n                        //'#21523a',\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'High income',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#000080' //Navy blue\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'Lower middle income',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#DAA520' //Goldenrod\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'Upper middle income',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#DC143C' //Crimson red\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'Unclassified',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#228B22' // Forest green\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            roam: true,\n            scaleLimit: {\n                min: 0.8, // minimum zoom level (0.5 means the chart can be zoomed out to half its original size)\n                max: 1.5   // maximum zoom level (2 means the chart can be zoomed in to twice its original size)\n            },\n            zoom: 0.9,\n            label: {\n                position: 'right',\n                formatter: '{b}',\n                color: 'inherit',\n                fontSize: 10\n            },\n            lineStyle: {\n                //color: '#7d84e3',\n                color: 'source',\n                opacity: 0.05,\n                curveness: 0.3\n            },\n            force: {\n                repulsion: 80,\n                edgeLength: 100\n            },\n            emphasis: {\n                focus: 'adjacency',//'series', //\n                lineStyle: {\n                    width: 10\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    };\n\n    option && myChart.setOption(option);\n}\n\nnew EchartsRunner()\n  .addCodes(country_code)\n  .show();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: The international collaboration network of all countries with over 200 publications\nAccording to our data, researchers from the United States have the highest rate of collaboration with other countries, with 48,156 instances of collaboration encompassing all countries with over 200 marine biodiversity related publications. Figure 14 shows the collaboration network for the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: The international collaboration network of the United States\nThe countries with the lowest number of international collaborations are the Low income country Madagascar, with 201 instances of collaboration and the Lower middle income country Senegal, with 203 instances of collaboration. Figure 15 shows the countries Malagasy researchers have collaborated with. Figure 16 shows the same for Senegal. It is clear from these figures that even countries with relatively few collaborations may still work with researchers from a diverse range of countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: The international collaboration network of Madagascar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: The international collaboration network of Senegal\nIn considering this data we would emphasise that as more data on author affiliations becomes available a clearer view is likely to emerge of country collaboration networks.\n\n\nFunding\nWithin scientific publications, funding information has typically been provided by researchers in the free form acknowledgements section.7 This often results in data that is unstructured and challenging to process. As discussed in Valuing the Deep, databases began incorporating the option to include funding details from the mid to late 2000s onwards. Since then, funding agencies have placed a greater emphasis on the inclusion of funding details in publications arising from their financial support. Recent additions to databases like OpenAlex include new funder identifiers to better link funding entities with publications. Yet, the data is still sparse. For instance, of the 476,661 publications in the marine dataset discussed here, only 55,700 (11.6%) contain funding details. Nonetheless, given the increasing importance of this data to funding bodies, which are accountable to taxpayers, we anticipate a future rise in the availability of such information. Figure 17 presents a summary of the available data on funding by organisation, country and the year relevant articles were published. We also include available data on trends in open access (orange) and closed access (blue) publications linked to funding data in OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: This figure shows available information for marine biodiversity related publications in a set of 55,700 publications as well as trends in the publications that include funding information. Data on trends in Open Access publications suggests that funding agencies increasingly promote and require open access publications.\nWhen considering Figure 17 and further visualisations of funding data it is important to note that the sparsity of the data means that we are ‘seeing through a glass darkly’. Caution is therefore encouraged in drawing conclusions about funding for marine biodiversity research in general or deep-sea research specifically. However, this data is valuable in highlighting the major funding agencies for marine biodiversity-related research and in identifying emerging funding networks. As discussed in Valuing the Deep, these networks are often invisible to funding agencies and to the wider research community.\nNote that the funding programmes of the European Union such as the Framework and more recent Horizon programmes are listed separately in the OpenAlex funding table, diminishing the visibility of the EU as a major funder of research in Figure 17.\nIt is possible to create collaboration networks for funding institutions showing which funding institutions have funded the same research publications. Figure 18 illustrates the primary collaboration links between funding agencies supporting more than 50 publications of marine biodiversity-related research.\n\nnew_funder = await FileAttachment(\"data/funders_june_countries2.json\").json();\n\nfunder_code = function() {\n    var [option, myChart] = this.getVars();\n\n    myChart.showLoading();\n\n    var graph = new_funder;\n\n    myChart.hideLoading();\n\n    graph.nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n        node.label = {\n            show: node.symbolSize &gt; 8\n        };\n    });\n\n    option = {\n        // title: {\n        //     text: 'Funder',\n        //     subtext: 'Default layout',\n        //     top: 'bottom',\n        //     left: 'right'\n        // },\n        tooltip: {},\n         legend: {\n             selectedMode: 'multiple',\n             data: graph.categories.filter(function(a) {\n                 return [\"European Union\", \"China\", \"Japan\", \"Russia\", \"Korea, Rep.\", \"United States\"].includes(a.name);\n             }).map(function(a) {\n                 return a.name;\n             }),\n             left: 'left'\n         },\n        animation: false,\n        //animationDuration: 400,\n        //animationEasingUpdate: 'quinticInOut',\n        series: [{\n            name: 'Funders',\n            type: 'graph',\n            layout: 'force',\n            data: graph.nodes,\n            links: graph.links,\n            categories: graph.categories,\n            roam: true,\n            scaleLimit: {\n                min: 0.7, // minimum zoom level (0.5 means the chart can be zoomed out to half its original size)\n                max: 1.5   // maximum zoom level (2 means the chart can be zoomed in to twice its original size)\n            },\n            zoom: 1,\n            label: {\n                position: 'right',\n                formatter: '{b}',\n                backgroundColor: '#fff', \n                borderColor: '#fff',  // Add border to labels\n                borderWidth: 3\n                //padding: [10, 10, 10, 10] Doesn't seem to be doing anything\n            },\n            labelLayout: {\n                hideOverlap: true\n            },\n            lineStyle: {\n                color: 'source',\n                opacity: 0.2,\n                curveness: 0.3\n            },\n            // force: {\n            //   repulsion: 25,\n            //   edgeLength: 40\n            //},\n            force: {\n                repulsion: [400, 800],\n                edgeLength: [100, 300]\n            },\n            emphasis: {\n                focus: 'adjacency',\n                lineStyle: {\n                    width: 10\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    };\n\n    option && myChart.setOption(option);\n}\n\nnew EchartsRunner()\n  .addCodes(funder_code)\n  .show();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Collaboration network of major funders of marine biodiversity research.\nFigure 19 shows the funding collaboration network for the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the funder of the most publications (9577) with the most collaborations (7496).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Funding collaboration network of the National Natural Science Foundation of China\nFigure 20 presents the network for the European Union.

Rather they display the output of researchers within the biodiversity graph. They serve both to highlight the importance of marine researchers and the topics they cover and to test the coverage of the graph. In the upper rankings we would expect to see senior researchers who are well known in marine biology or closely related fields. Note that author rankings are affected by the availability of data and a known issue arising from naming conventions in East Asia and elsewhere is that author names of distinct persons may become conflated.\nWe can gain an appreciation of the diversity of researchers and their research by selecting a sample of researchers’ profiles. Other than brief comments we will allow these to speak for themselves. We include titles in the display to illustrate the topics addressed by individual authors. The most prolific author within this dataset is Jehee Lee from Jeju National University in the Republic of Korea as shown in Figure 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: This figure offers insights into the publication history of Jehee Lee, who has frequently published on subjects relating to marine biodiversity.\nProfessor Lee’s profile reveals an interest in the active properties of a range of marine organisms including marine snails (abalone), clams, the rock bream, mullet and marine bacteria. In practice, our marine biodiversity graph captures only part of Professor Lee’s overall publication portfolio; any publications which do not meet the criteria for the biodiversity graph will have been excluded.\nFigure 23 shows the profile of Professor Eric Kandel, whose research focuses on neuroscience, memory and sea slugs (Aplysia). Professor Kandel was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000 and his research has focused on a number of different marine invertebrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: This figure offers insights into the publication history of Eric Kandel, who has frequently published on subjects related to marine biodiversity.\nThe vital role women play in marine scientific research is reflected in the work of Rita Colwell (Figure 24), who conducted her Ph.D. research in aquatic microbiology and would go on to focus in detail on Vibrio and Vibrio cholerea. Professor Colwell was the first woman to be appointed as the Director of the National Science Foundation. A wider view of the contributions of women to men in marine scientific research could be gained by calculating the ratio of women to men in the field. However, the analysis of person names by sex or gender in multiple languages is not straightforward and fuller exploration of the contribution of women to marine scientific research is therefore a topic for future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: This figure offers insights into the publication history of Rita Colwell, who has frequently published on subjects related to marine biodiversity.\nFinally, it is also important to emphasise, as discussed in depth in the WIPO landscape on marine genetic resources, that researchers from developing countries are also very active in marine research as Figure 8 has already revealed.\nProfessor Baldomero Olivera is originally from the Philippines and has mainly pursued his career at the University of Utah. His profile within the marine graph is displayed in Figure 25. Professor Olivera’s research has focused on marine cone snail toxins that have proved to be a rich source of pharmacologically active peptides (see Oldham, Shale and Kindness 2019). Professor Olivera has collaborated closely with Professor Lourdes Cruz at the University of the Philippines Diliman and shared the 2022 AAAS “Golden Goose” award for obscure federally sponsored research that produced unlikely and unexpected benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: This figure offers insights into the publication history of Baldomero Olivera, who has frequently published on subjects related to marine biodiversity.\n\n\nApplied Research\nAs we have already seen in the brief researcher profiles, potential practical applications have been a central focus of research on marine organisms. We can gain a clearer view of applied research using information on chemical compounds for the records available through the Lens Scholarly API service as set out in Figure 26. The data is limited to publications that appear in the PubMed database for biomedically focused research. PubMed applies the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) classification. This data is available for 136,982 of the publications in the dataset and will not cover publications outside PubMed.\nFigure 26 reveals a range of different topics that are important in marine research, such as work on water pollutants. Figure 26 focuses on research on marine organisms for anti-cancer (anti-neoplastic) agents and highlights the main research topics, the organisms involved such as Dolabella auricularia or the dodge sea hare as well as the institutions involved in research publications on anti-cancer agents.\nSo far we have focused on providing a general portrait for marine biodiversity research using a citation graph based approach. We will now focus specifically on research in ABNJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Supplementary information on chemical substances is available for 136,982 publications and is limited to publications appearing PubMed (biomedically focused research) that uses the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) classification.",

    "section": "Defining the Deep Sea",
    "text": "Defining the Deep Sea\nThe Valuing the Deep study highlighted the primary analytical challenge of differentiating between samples collected within national jurisdictions and those sourced from the High Seas. In simpler terms, the fundamental question posed is: where was this sample obtained from? The proposition for the BBNJ unique standardised batch identifier, as outlined in the new BBNJ Treaty, offers a resolution to this dilemma by introducing a straightforward batch identifier for samples collected from the High Seas. Once applied to samples collected on a research cruise, or an undersea installation, the identifier cascades into collections, databases of digital objects such as digital sequence information, publications and patents.\nIn the interim before the identifier becomes operational, we are confronted with the challenge of distinguishing between research on marine biodiversity and genetic resources in general and that conducted specifically within the High Seas. Valuing the Deep approached this challenge by combining data from different specialist databases and OBIS. An updated version of that approach centres around crafting a working definition of High Seas research based on scoreable parameters.\nOne advantage of a working definition approach is that the parameters can be adjusted and updated as more data becomes available and experience is generated in use of the definition. Second, a working definition enjoys the benefit of methodological transparency by clearly outlining the parameters and data sources utilised in defining High Seas research. Another potential advantage is that it may be applicable both inside and outside of scientific literature. Finally, the working definition can serve as an intermediate step until such time that the BBNJ identifier comes into operation. The working definition, insofar that it succeeds in isolating high seas research, can then assist in developing experiments to test data capture using the batch identifier prior to its full roll out through the Clearing House Mechanism. As such, in the interim period leading to the entry into force of the treaty a working definition can also contribute to testing out how the batch identifier will work in practice.\nThe working definition consists of the three main elements:\n\nA) Named Places\nA number of dictionaries are available with the coordinates of named places in the world’s oceans, these include:\n\nThe General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Gazetteer created by the International Hydrographic Organisation and UNESCO, which is the key authoritative resource for named underwater places.\nThe InterRidge vents database for hydrothermal vents.\nThe Seamounts Online database with names and coordinates for seamounts (discontinued)\nThe Geonames public contribution dataset of underwater place names (terrestrial aquatic and marine)\nCoordinates for Cold Water Corals including named places (e.g.seamounts)\n\nWe can visually illustrate the application of this approach using geographic place names. Figure 27 displays the coordinates for 17,777 distinct named places and 22,921 variant names derived from the sources noted above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27: A compilation of 17,777 named underwater places with coordinates from four sources. Large features in the GEBCO Gazetteer such as ridges, trenches etc. have been reduced to their centroid coordinates. (Click to expand the image in a new tab)\nIn considering Figure 27 it is important to note that some of the named places may appear in freshwater terrestrial settings. These are mainly from the open access Geonames dataset and include, for example, subglacial basins in Antarctica and are derived from entries coded U for Undersea in Geonames or appearing in the Geonames ‘no country’ dataset. Other named places are found in lakes and rivers.\nThe GEBCO Gazetteer includes coordinates for large features such as seamounts, ridges and troughs in the form of line strings, polygons and multipolygons. For these larger features we use the geometric centroid because it allows us to aggregate records to the named place. In a small number of cases this may lead to duplication of a named place (where a point is provided in the underlying data and we use a centroid). We also note that it is possible that for large geological features it is possible that some parts of the feature will fall inside the EEZ while other parts fall into ABNJ. Cases where this could apply have not been identified.\nNamed underwater places share the characteristic that they have commonly been given multiple names or variants of names in multiple languages. In some datasets these are referred to as preferred names with synonyms. Wherever possible we retain the variants of names which will be aggregated to the same data point. We awarded unique identifiers to each place and its corresponding variant to allow the data to be aggregated.\nThe use of named places with coordinates allows the relationship between a named place and the EEZ (taken as a single global entity) to be calculated using the Marine Regions EEZ map. This is achieved by calculating those coordinates that fall inside the global EEZ and those that fall into ABNJ. Figure 28 shows the impact of this approach. Note that the Marine Regions map of the global EEZ includes an EEZ around Antarctica which is not correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 28: Named marine places that are located in the EEZ and ABNJ. (Click to expand the image in a new tab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: Named marine places that are located in the High Seas (ABNJ). (Click to expand the image in a new tab)\nFigure 29 shows the impact of removing those named places falling inside the EEZ from the display.\nIn total this approach identified 3,029 places in the High Seas associated with 4,397 names including name variants. Note that because Antarctica is represented on the Marine Regions shapefile as possessing an EEZ we will undercount named places in ABNJ for the waters around Antarctica.\n\n\nB) Dictionaries of Terms\nDictionaries of terms can be used to search the scientific literature, patents and web pages. These include:\n\nUnderwater features at varying levels of detail (e.g.the water column, hydrothermal vent(s), seabed, seamounts or guyots, mud volcanoes, cold seeps, cold water corals, depth characteristics such as pelagic, mesopelagic, hadal etc.). Underwater features are mainly derived from the generic term field in the GEBCO Gazetteer.\nDeep sea terms that are widely used in the high seas research literature (e.g. deep sea, deepsea, deep-sea, high seas, ABNJ etc).\nAn Oceans dictionary for the world’s major oceans.\nA Seas dictionary containing names of the world’s seas, which are typically inside national jurisdiction. This can be used for the purposes of excluding records.\n\nDictionary based approaches are relatively simple. The Features dictionary was compiled from the GEBCO Gazetteer generic names values (e.g. seamount) with additions from a review of top feature related words and phrases that appear in the marine dataset (single words and phrases). Dictionaries of the World’s Oceans and Seas are available through the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Limits of Oceans and Seas (3rd edition, 1953). At this stage we focused only on compiling terms in English with terms in other languages to be added at a later date if it proves useful to further pursue the working definition.\nFigure 30 showcases the outcomes of entity extraction using a dictionary, represented as the number of publications in the marine set. It is worth noting that, as is often the case, some terms will prove to be noisy and necessitate further review for possible exclusion (e.g. ‘the gut’, ‘the gap’ etc.) while other terms could benefit from further aggregation. Manual review and refinement of terms is crucial to ensure precise data capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30: Illustrative rankings of document counts from dictionaries\n\n\nC) Taxonomic Records\nTaxonomic records are typically found in OBIS and include:\n\nSpecies occurrence records with coordinates for organisms in ABNJ. This is in effect, a calculation on OBIS occurrence records. OBIS currently lists 8.9 million occurrence records for 27,740 species and 38,546 taxa for ABNJ.\nOrganisms listed in OBIS as deep sea organisms through the World Register of Deep Sea Species (WoRDSS, now part of WoRMS which contributes to OBIS).\nTaxa appearing in the Chessbase database for organisms from deep sea chemosynthetic environments and recorded in OBIS.\nEntries marked as ‘High Seas’ by researchers and publishers contributing to OBIS.\n\nOne benefit of a working definition approach is that records can be scored based on whether they meet TRUE/FALSE criteria, and those scores can be weighted in different ways to reflect their importance.\nFor example, what we call GEBCO feature terms are individual words that describe an underwater feature such as ‘vent’, ‘trough’, ‘trench’, ‘ridge’, ‘column’ and ‘zone’. Some of these terms, such as vent, are quite distinctive but others may be in very widespread use, such as column (for column chromatography) or zone (e.g. for the zone of a gene or genome). As such, some individual terms that describe features may be very noisy in nature and therefore merit a lower weighted score.\nIn contrast, feature words are precise underwater place names that are situated in ABNJ. Where a record contains an ABNJ place name it is virtually certain that the record involves research in the high seas. The measure therefore merits the highest weighted score.\nOther measures within the working definition, notably taxonomic names, are more ambiguous due to ambiguity in the underlying data. For example, the OBIS use of a marine label for data does not in reality mean that a particular species is exclusively marine. Similarly, the calculation that a species only occurs in ABNJ using OBIS data is unlikely to fully hold true. A case in point is Trichoderma harzianum, a fungus that is found in marine environments but is widespread in other environments. In OBIS data this fungus is labelled as marine only and is also recorded in the OBIS data for ABNJ. As such, the fungus will wrongly receive a high score across multiple measures in the working definition.\nAs noted above, species occurrence records for deep sea organisms can be identified in OBIS data for Chessbase and WoRDSS. In addition, as noted above, in its public interface OBIS currently lists 8.9 million occurrence records for 27,740 species and 38,546 taxa for ABNJ. We further restricted the data to marine only organisms by filtering out taxa with records from terrestrial, brackish or freshwater environments. We also filtered out any records with a continent, country, state province, municipality or similar code. The results are set out in Figure 31.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 31: OBIS Occurrence Records in ABNJ\nThe application of these filters reduced the number of taxonomic names to 7,982 in 1,477,285 occurrence records as shown in Table 3. We refer to this as the ‘ABNJ only’ group as a working set consisting of 6,203 unique binomial names and 1,779 higher order or uninomial taxonomic names. The latter are likely to encompass organisms found in multiple environments.\nTable 3: Occurrence Rankings for Marine Organisms in ABNJ by number of occurrence records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top organisms in Table 3 in terms of the number of occurrences are Antarctic krill, Bigeye tuna, Swordfish, the Copepod Calanus finmarchicus found mainly in the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean Copepod Calanus simillimus along with other krill species such as Thysanoessa macrura and Copepod Rhincalanus gigas.\nThis indicates that organisms that are recorded with high frequency in ABNJ are typically found in shallower waters and, in the case of krill, tuna and swordfish, will be commercially significant for fisheries.\nTaken together, the combination of working definition elements provides a structured way of focusing analysis on research in the High Seas.",

    "section": "Applying the Working Definition",
    "text": "Applying the Working Definition\nThe three categories of data identified above are used to construct a working definition with weighted scores. Table 4 sets out the criteria and weighted scores for the working definition.\nTable 4: Weighted Criteria for the Working Definition with explanatory notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5 shows examples of matching scientific publications against the weighted criteria mentioned above. The figure shows the OpenAlex publication identifier, the total score of the record against the criteria and a selection of columns.\nTable 5: Weighted criteria applied to individual records (selection for display).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ranked totals for the criteria across the dataset are summarised in Table 6.\nTable 6: Marine Working Definition Rankings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn interpreting Table 6 we can immediately observe that the majority of the overall marine dataset falls within the group 1 range of the working definition. That is, the records, even where they involve a marine organism do not contain a reference to a marine feature, or place name that would move them out of the group 1 range under the weighted criteria. Two large groupings of publications are found in groups 2 and 3 respectively and are dominated by members of Vibrio, Trichoderma and Mytilus as well as White Spot Syndrome Virus (affecting shrimp) as well as a range of plants such as the algae Dunaliella salina and the seagrass Posidonia oceanica.\nA distinctive cluster of documents emerges in Group 5. Taken together Group 4 to 10 consist of 26,413 documents and will be our focus.\n\nLevel 4 and Above\nA focus on records with a score of 4 or above limits the dataset to 26,413 records in total representing 5.5% of the overall raw marine dataset. Figure 32 displays the top organisms meeting these criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Marine Species and Uninomial Names (n = 26,413)\nAt this level, the focus has narrowed considerably to species associated with the oceans and ABNJ. Prominent species include the copepod Calanus finmarchicus which is widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean. The second highest ranked species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The prominence of the widely distributed fungus Cladosporium herbarum, a common allergen, could initially be dismissed as the intrusion of noise except for the commercial interest in marine Cladosporium as a source of novel metabolites with a range of potential applications.8 Further down the rankings, we find the red seabream (Pargus major) as a commercially important fish species, the Norwegian lobster Nephrops norvegicus and Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. This suggests that while the focus is narrowing we will observe a mix of marine organisms from the EEZ and ABNJ.\nFigure 33 displays trends in publications at rank 4 and above and the top concepts associated with publications. Note here that a very distinct trough appears in the data that is assumed to reflect the absence of open access forms of abstracts in Open Alex rather than a decline in activity.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33: Overview of Research Activity at Rank 4 and Above (n = 26,413)\nIn considering data by country, note that we observe a similar pattern to the more general marine data, except that China appears to become less prominent as the working definition takes us into deeper waters inside the EEZ and into BBNJ. This pattern is reflected in the available data on author affiliations for publications where we can also observe that the University of Sao Paulo is moving up the rankings. We would caution however, that these changes could reflect gaps in the availability of affiliation data in the publication dataset where 355,270 of the 476,661 records contain country information. In total, 16,325 records (61%) of the 26,413 publications at level 4 and above possess country affiliation information and 10,088 do not.\nA wider view of trends in activity by country and United Nations Region is provided in Figure 34. All major world regions continue to be represented. The proportion of participation, measured as a percentage share of publications reveals potentially interesting features. Thus, across the 355,270 publications in the raw marine graph with country data, countries in the Africa region accrued 12,967 publications (3.65% of the total). At level 4 and above we observe participation by Africa in 515 publications representing 3.15% . A similar pattern where regions appear to hold their share with some minor variation is also suggested in this data. This could be interpreted as meaning that as research moves into deeper waters, it does not necessarily follow that the participation of developing countries decreases radically (expressed in terms of publications). However, the gaps in affiliation country information mean that it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion about this data, expect that a more nuanced interpretation of country participation in marine research in ABNJ may be possible. Furthermore, it is desirable to promote the inclusion of country information for all authors to provide a clearer view in future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 34: Trends in Activity by Country and UN Regions and Sub-Regions (n = 26,413 of which 16,325 have country information)\nFigure 35 displays an overview of author rankings for the data at level 4 and above. This is mainly intended to assist with community sanity checking of the data at different levels but also to highlight that contributions to marine scientific research ultimately originate from the work of individual researchers and research teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 35: Authors Profile for Level 4 and Above (n = 26,413)\nThe top ranking authors in the level 4 data include Gregg Rouse at the Scripps Institute who has published on topics such as bone eating worms and more broadly on the phylogeny of a range of marine organisms. Guillermo San Martin from the Autonomous University of Madrid has published extensively on new species and annelids. Tetsuya Komori and Ryota Higuchi have jointly published on glycosides from starfish (Asteroidea). The Dutch marine biologist R.W.M van Soest is a specialist in sponges (Porifera) while Joan Enric Cartes is a specialist in the ecology of deep-sea ecosystems in the Mediterranean and Atlantic.\nA brief review of the titles of publications in Figure 35 suggests that we are still in the realms of a mix of EEZ and BBNJ publications.\nFigure 36 displays the available data from publications appearing in PubMed on chemical compounds that are a focus of research (based on MeSH terms). Figure 36 suggests the dominance of research on the identification of bacteria at level 4 (marked by the prominence of 16S Ribosomal RNA in the rankings).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 36: Available data on Medical Subject Headings For Level 4 and Above\nIn considering the data in Figure 36 we see an emphasis on basic research including classification as well as references in the more detailed topic qualifiers to isolation and purification, pharmacology and enzymology suggesting applied research. Albeit at a lower level (not shown), the titles of publications also suggest a growing focus on hydrothermal vents in a range of different areas, including work on a candidate new species of epibiont living on the deep-sea hydrothermal vent shrimp Rimicaris exoculata.\nAs we narrow the focus to level 6 and above in the working definition, these trends will become more prominent.\n\n\nLevel 6 and Above\nAt level 6 and above the data narrows considerably to 1,749 records. This makes up 0.3% of the overall marine dataset.\nAt level 6 and above, Figure 37 reveals that the taxonomic data narrows on the species level to Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the blind shrimp Rimicaris exoculata which is found in abundance at hydrothermal vents in the mid-Atlantic ridge, the bivalve Bathymodiolus azoricus found at vent sites in the Azores Triple Junction and Logatchev hydrothermal vent field, the polycheate Pompeii worm Alvinella pompejana found at vent sites in the Pacific Ocean, and the Giant Tube Worm Riftia pachyptila first described in 1981 at a Galapagos Rift vent site.10 Other species that emerge in this data include the abyssal grenadier fish Coryphaenoides armatus found at depth in many of the world’s oceans and the deepwater mussel Bathymodiolus thermophilus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 37: Overview of Species and Uninomial names in Publication Rankings at Level 6 and above (n = 1,749)\nFigure 38 reveals a peak of 61 publications in 2008. With respect to Concepts we begin to see ‘Hydrothermal Circulation’ and ‘Hydrothermal vent’ are rising rapidly up the rankings. The relative country rankings also begin to change, with France moving up in position and countries such as Brazil and China (among others) beginning to drop down the rankings. This is also reflected in the relative positions of organisations in the affiliations, with two French organisations taking a clear lead followed by an Oceanology Institute in Russia. Here we would note that it is important not to read too much into these rankings given the limitations of available affiliation data. Nevertheless, level 6 and above in the working definition appears to mark a transition point towards institutions and research teams specialising in deep sea research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 38: Overview of Species and Uninomial Publication Rankings at Level 6 and above (n = 1,749, 1,212 with affiliation country data)\nFigure 39 displays a detailed breakout of publication activity by country with percentage shares of publications by UN regions and sub-regions.\nIn considering the country rankings we observe that the US remains the single standout country. However, Europe’s share of activity is increasing. Latin America and the Caribbean are holding their position. South-East Asia shows a decline in its share. Oceania’s share increases and also narrows in terms of the participation of researchers from the Oceania sub-regions being limited to Australia & New Zealand and Melanesia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 39: Publication Rankings by Country and UN Region at Level 6 and above (n = 1,749, 1,212 with affiliation country data)\nFigure 40 displays authors ranked by publication at level 6 and above in the working definition. The publication counts have a narrow range and this measure is intended to highlight that marine scientific research is conducted by real people and teams and to encourage community suggestions for improvements to the working definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 40: Publication Rankings by Authors at Level 6 and above (n = 1,749, 1,212 with affiliation country data)\nAt this level we observe researchers including Didier Jollivet with the CNRS who works on the nucleotide diversity of annelid worms in extreme environments. We also observe Michel Segonzac at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, Pierre-Marie Sarradin who leads the Deep Sea Ecosystems Research Unit at IFREMER and Daniel Desbruyères who also specialises in deep sea ecosystems at IFREMER. Elsewhere in the table Francoise Gaill is a senior deep sea biologist at CNRS who has conducted pioneering research on hydrothermal vents while Paul Tyler is a deep ocean specialist and Emeritus Professor in Ocean and Earth Science at the National Oceanography Centre Southampton. Looking beyond France and the UK we also observe Andrey Gebruk of the P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology specialising in hydrothermal shrimp, Timothy Shank at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute focusing on the ecology of deep-ocean benthic ecosystems and Hiromi Watanabe at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science Technology whose research topics include genetic divergence and migration patterns.\nOf particular interest at this level is the prominent work of women scientists including Angelika Brandt at Goethe University Frankfurt specialising in deep sea biodiversity in Antarctica, Cindy Lee Van Dover at Duke who pioneered research on hydrothermal vents, Nadine Le Bris at Sorbonne University specialising in chemosynthetic communities and Jozee Sarazin at IFREMER researching deep benthos assemblages.\nIn total, and prior to data cleaning, over 4,000 researchers appear on publications at level 6 and above suggesting that while the number of researchers who actively conduct research in the deep oceans may be limited, they form part of extensive networks.\nFigure 41 displays the available data from medical subject headings at level 6 and above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 41: Publication Rankings involving Chemical Compounds at level 6 and above (n = 3,189)\nThis suggests that we have indeed progressed into the deep oceans through the references to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and to hydrothermal vents. Our aim has been to progressively refine the focus from general marine biodiversity, through research in the deep oceans inside the EEZ and ABNJ towards research conducted in ABNJ.",

    "text": "Named Places in ABNJ in the Scientific Literature\nThe working definition presented above reveals that a fundamental precondition for the identification of research activity in BBNJ in the absence of the BBNJ batch identifier is the presence of a reference to a named place. A named place may be a Sea that is entirely within BBNJ such as the Ross, Weddell or Sargasso Seas or, more usually, a named underwater place from the GEBCO Gazetteer, seamount, hydrothermal vent or cold water coral datasets.\nFigure 42 shows the results of mapping named underwater places in the scientific literature in accordance with whether a named place appears inside the EEZ or in ABNJ. The data includes a small number of place names that appear in the scientific literature but do not appear in the reference sets. The latter were geocoded using the Google Maps API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 42: Named Underwater Places in the Scientific Literature in the EEZ and ABNJ (Click to expand the image in a new tab)\n\nIn total we identified 7,204 publications for marine organisms involving 607 underwater places either in the EEZ or ABNJ.

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis presented here is, to our knowledge, the second in depth analysis of research activity in ABNJ following the earlier Valuing the Deep study. As this analysis has made clear, what has changed in the intervening decade is the ability of the research community to access data on the scientific literature at scale and to combine data from different sources (notably taxonomic data from OBIS and GBIF as well as geographic data) in ways that were previously very difficult to achieve at scale. In part these advances are made possible by the use of machine learning models to automate named entity recognition at the scale of hundreds of millions of documents. At the same time, the rise of Large Language Models (as we demonstrate later) provides, subject to appropriate quality controls, important opportunities to automate elements of data retrieval and analysis that must presently be conducted by humans.\nThe analysis in this section also exposes the ongoing challenges in large scale bibliometric analysis. These challenges are not specific to research on BBNJ but are worth noting as: incomplete access to data to facilitate statistical analysis of trends, and; incomplete data on author affiliations and funders. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise that the situation is much improved both in terms of the quantity and quality of data available and in the availability of tools to work with data at scale.\nA main focus of this discussion has been to advance the idea of a working definition for research in ABNJ consisting of a weighted multi-criteria matrix for identifying research that is more likely to be taking place in BBNJ. The experimental approach to the working definition presented here is intended to bridge the gap, and contribute to the assessment of, the eventual roll out of the BBNJ standardised batch identifier established under the Treaty. In concrete terms, in the intervening period before the deployment of the batch identifier, we anticipate that the working definition could be further refined and its use automated for retrieving research relevant to the Treaty and its scientific community. The working definition and data presented here could also contribute to piloting the identifier and to the eventual assessment of the effectiveness of the identifier in capturing research conducted in BBNJ. Put in other terms, the working definition can serve as a useful temporary stop-gap measure in capturing marine research in BBNJ and provide useful points of reference in constructing a better way forward.",

    "text": "Introduction\nPatent activity for marine genetic resources was an important focus of debate during the negotiation of the BBNJ Treaty. In the economics and science policy literature, patent data is important because it provides a proxy indicator for underlying investments in research and development that is otherwise invisible. That is, trends in patent activity serve as a proxy output indicator for trends in research and development. As such, patent data provides an indicator for whether a particular area of technology is currently an important focus of investment in research and development or not.\nPatent data can be counted in a variety of ways in order to provide different insights into areas of activity:\nThe first time a patent application is filed anywhere in the world is known as a “priority” or “first” filing. Because the date of a priority or first filing is the closest to the date of the underlying investment in research and development this is the most commonly used count for patent activity in the economics literature and is widely used for statistical purposes by organisations such as the OECD, Eurostat and patent offices. However, its use as an indicator suffers from the lag time between the date of first filing and publication (typically at least two years) meaning that patent data always lags behind actual activity. As such, patent activity describes historic activity. We use INPADOC patent families, as contained in the EPO World Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT, spring edition 2024) as the basis for the counts in this section.1\nCounts of patent families. A first filing in a single country may lead to multiple follow on publications and filings in the form of applicants and grants in the same country or in other countries. These later filings and any grants that arise from them are called ‘family members’ of the original or priority first filing. The publication and republication of the same document in multiple countries and multiple languages leads to large scale duplication in patent data. The growing globalisation of patent protection through international instruments such as the Patent Cooperation Treaty and the regional European Patent Convention has accelerated this trend. Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty an applicant can submit an application for potential consideration in multiple countries. However, there is no ‘global patent’ and applicants must pay for each stage of the procedure as an application moves towards becoming a potential patent grant in each country where an application is filed. Because applicants have to pay at various stages, patent family information provides an indicator of demand, in the form of willingness to pay, on the part of the applicants. As such, it provides an indicator of the importance of a claimed invention or set of claimed inventions to applicants. We use INPADOC patent families, as contained in the EPO World Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT, spring edition 2024) as the basis for the counts of worldwide patent family members.\nIt is important to emphasise that different counts of patent data reveal different insights and it is also important to be careful in the use of language around the term ‘patent’ in order to avoid accidentally misleading the reader. In the following analysis the term patent document is used throughout. The term ‘patent grant’ is only used where a granted patent is known to exist and will always refer to a specific jurisdiction.\nIn the analysis to follow, we focus mainly on two indicators:",

    "text": "trends in first filings involving marine genetic resources using INPADOC patent families;\ntrends in demand for patent protection involving marine genetic resources through counts of INPADOC patent family members.\n\n\nThe Patent Data\nWe used the ABSPAT patent index developed by One World Analytics as the basis for the analysis. The ABSPAT index is an index of biodiversity relevant entities, consisting of taxonomic names, common names, virus names, habitats, country and place names that appear in the full text of the patent documents from the European Patent Office (EPO), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Patent Cooperation Treaty published between 1976 and the present (currently, to the end of December 2023). These offices are major drivers of the global patent system and patent applicants will typically file in multiple countries for inventions that are economically important to them. The focus on these three offices is intended to capture claimed inventions that are internationally important. For example, in focusing on the United States approximately 40% of patent filings with the USPTO originate from applicants outside the United States. In Europe, the European Patent Convention is the key vehicle for securing protection across its 39 member states. The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is administered by WIPO and is the main vehicle for the pursuit of patent protection worldwide. This approach is not intended to capture patent activity for purely domestic markets (e.g.not pursued in other markets outside the home market). The approach is similar to that pioneered by the OECD in focusing its statistical indicators on the US, the EPC and Japan (known as the Trilateral Offices) with the exception that biodiversity based analysis is dependent on access to the full texts of patent documents.2 At the time of writing, the ABSPAT index contained 1.4 million biodiversity related first filings of patent applications linked to 10.9 million patent family members worldwide.\nAs discussed in detail in the 2019 WIPO Patent Landscape Report on Marine Genetic Resources, our ability to conduct analysis across all countries worldwide is heavily constrained by access to national collections in public or private databases.3 For example, the patent collections for India and ASEAN countries are only partially accessible and are under-represented in statistical databases such as the EPO World Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT). As such, it is important to recognise the constraints imposed by lack of access to national patent collections for patent analysis. In addition, the diversity of languages that may be used within the global patent system is also a limiting factor. However, while noting these data constraints, the ability to map patent families worldwide using PATSTAT provides important opportunities to understand trends in global demand across countries for marine genetic resources and those from ABNJ. Readers interested in gaining an in depth understanding of the methods used in this study should consult the second edition of the WIPO Manual on Open Source Patent Analytics for beginners and the WIPO Patent Analytics Handbook for intermediate and advanced users.\nFor the purpose of consistency, the same basic methodology is applied to the patent data as for the scientific literature considered in the previous section. In this case the available full texts of patent documents relevant to biodiversity, consisting of the titles, abstracts, descriptions and claims are broken down into individual sentences and processed using the Humboldt Named Entity Recognition model. Patent full texts are sourced using the Lens patent API from the non-profit CAMBIA in Australia. The results of the text analysis are joined to the EPO Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) as the international gold standard for patent statistics. The results are also federated with other datasets, notably the taxonomic backbone of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and OBIS, and filtered down to marine organisms. The use of sentence level analysis allows for fine grained analysis of the presence of marine resources in conjunction with other information, such as known underwater features and locations.\n\n\nGeneral Overview\nAs noted in the discussion of the scientific literature, an organism recorded in the marine environment may also be recorded in other environments. This has a major impact on the analysis of patent data because patent documents involving biodiversity frequently if not normally make reference to multiple species which may come from a range of environments. The challenge, as we will see, is to filter the data to those documents involving marine environments and then to focus further on patent activity originating from organisms in the high seas where an organism is the focus of the patent claims.\nIn order to introduce the reader to the issues involved in patent data, we will begin with a general overview of patent activity involving any binomial species name that is classified in OBIS as appearing in a marine environment, including model organisms, as set out in Figure 45. In total, we identified 4,903 binomial taxonomic names in the OBIS marine group in patent data from 1891 to 2023 (available data to date in PATSTAT Spring 2024). For greater clarity in the presentation of data on applicants, we exclude the names of individual persons and focus on organisations.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 45: A summary overview of first filings of INPADOC patent families at the USPTO, the European Patent Office and the Patent Cooperation Treaty that mention marine organisms (including model organisms). (Applicants data excludes individuals).\nThese organisms were associated with a total of 53,768 first filings (INPADOC patent families) between 1990 and 2021. Trends in first filings display an overall rising trend across this period before encountering a data cliff due to the lag times between the filing of an application and its publication (at least 24 months). This illustrates a major issue with patent data in the form of timeliness. In short, we are always observing historic activity with recent activity hidden from view due to lag times between filing and publication. In observing trends in first filings note that patent data for first filings always displays a data cliff at least three/four years prior to the present date and this should not be interpreted as representing a decline in activity.\nFigure 45 reveals that the top area of activity involving marine organisms is biotechnology and genetic engineering, pharmaceuticals followed by peptides, plant agriculture in the form of ‘new plants’ involving genetic engineering along with fermentation and measuring and testing processes, biocides, foods and cosmetics are lower down the list. The top applicants involve large agricultural companies, enzyme producing companies such as Novozymes (now Novonesis), universities that are heavily active in filing for patents such as the University of California system, Harvard and MIT, companies such as MS Technologies LLC involved in sensor technologies chemical companies such as Dupont and personal care companies such as Proctor and Gamble.\nFigure 45 also provides an insight into the countries where patent applications involving marine organisms are filed for the first time. Figure 45 reveals the dominance of filings in the United States, the European Patent Office and the Patent Cooperation Treaty. This is followed by China and Japan and a mix of developed and developing countries with the latter dominated by BRICS countries.5 It is important to note that countries such as China are playing an increasing role in the international patent landscape as we can clearly see in Figure 45 and are increasingly overtaking more established users of the patent system. In considering Figure 45 note that while filings will normally display a bias towards home nationals, in major markets such as the United States over 50% of filings may originate from non-residents.[^patents-6] As such the statistics will in part display the choices made by applicants on where to file first.\nFigure 45 focuses on activity measured by first filings of patent applications anywhere in the world. However, as noted above, a single patent filing may go on to be published as an application and grant multiple times in the same country or in other countries that participate in regional or international instruments (notably the Patent Cooperation Treaty administered by WIPO). Later patent applications and grants that link to an original first filing as their parent are called ‘family members’6. Figure 46 shows global patent activity for these family members and consists of follow on applications and grants involving marine organisms of any kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 46: A summary overview of global patent family members consisting of applications and grants involving marine organisms (including model organisms). (Applicants data excludes individuals).\nIn comparing Figure 46 with Figure 45 we can immediately detect a change of scale, notably in the graph displaying trends. This reflects the radical multiplier effects created by international patent instruments such as the Patent Cooperation Treaty and regional instruments such as the European Patent Convention. Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty an applicant can submit a single application which is then transmitted to multiple patent offices of their choice. The application will then be republished as an application in that country and, where relevant, may be republished as a patent grant. This change of scale can also clearly be seen in the ranked data for patent family countries and in this case refers to the countries, as markets, where protection is being sought.\nThese multiplier effects arise from the submission of applications that go on to be republished as applications and possible grants in multiple other countries. In considering Figure 46 we can also detect the emerging importance of BRICS countries with China and Brazil particularly apparent, followed by South Africa. Access to patent data is limited for countries such as India and regions such as South East Asia and activity for some countries and regions will therefore be under-represented in PATSTAT due to a lack of access to data.\nTrends in patent family members are mapped based on publication year and will typically display a smoother line than activity measured by first filings. Counts of patent family data also ‘lean forward’ compared with filing data because filing trends are counted by the earliest filing date while patent family members are counted by their publication date (which will be two years or more later). As a consequence, the data cliff represented by a lack of complete publication data will also appear roughly two years prior to the present. Again, this data cliff should not be interpreted as a decline in activity. Blips in activity or longer term trends typically only become fully visible some years after the event.\nFinally in considering Figure 46 the rankings by applicants reveal higher overall scores encompassing both applications, grants and amendments to patent documents. More importantly, this data will reflect the strategies developed by applicants in pursuing patent protection in different markets around the world. That is, we can see how important the pursuit of patent protection in multiple markets is to individual organisations and companies.\nAn important purpose of this overview is to introduce different ways of counting patent data and outline some of the issues involved in counting data for marine organisms and ABNJ in particular. These issues come into sharper focus when we consider the data on the taxonomy of the organisms inside the patent documents in Figure 47. Figure 47 displays the counts of first filings (patent families), applications and publications (family members) to show how follow on filings and republications of patent applications in multiple countries dramatically increases the scale of the counts. Thus, for fungi, 42,792 first filings led to 201,764 applications which in turn resulted in the 278,382 publications of applications and grants around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 47: Rankings first filings of patent applications involving marine organisms from OBIS.\nIn considering Figure 47 we are immediately struck by the prominence of fungi in the patent data, whereas we might ordinarily associate the marine environment with animals (Animalia), plants (Plantae) and bacteria. The presence of widespread and widely used fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus and plants such as Beta vulgaris (common beetroot) and Beta vulgaris maritima (sea beet) suggesting that something may be amiss with the data. It is only as we move further down the list towards Cocos nucifera (coconut) and the bioluminescent jellyfish Aequorea victoria that we move into more obviously marine territory. An issue here is the widespread use of organisms as research tools, such as S. cerevisiae, and the ubiquity of some organisms across environments making it difficult to clearly distinguish organisms by environment.\nA second introductory issue when working with patent data is that we are focusing here on patent documents that mention marine organisms somewhere in the text. Patent activity involving biodiversity commonly, and indeed normally, makes reference to multiple species that may be found in multiple environments.\nA third introductory issue is that species that appear in patent documents may or may not be part of, or material to, the claimed invention. That is, in the language of the new WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, a claimed invention may not be based on the organism referenced in the document. We can draw closer to the analysis of patent activity specifically focused on marine organisms by identifying marine organisms that appear in the patent claims, as illustrated in the lower panel of Figure 47\nIn interpreting the data on the appearance of taxonomic names in patent we can immediately observe that the appearance of a marine organism in the claims section normally occurs at a much lower frequency than in the overall patent data. In other words, an organisms will be mentioned in a patent document much more commonly than it appears in the claims. However, it is important also to emphasise that patent claims are commonly constructed at the level of the genus, family or class of organism in order to maximise the scope of protection for the claimed invention. For example, it is common place to see references to ‘mammals’ in patent claims in order to broadly encompass a class of organism or family or genus names. This can make it challenging to interpret whether a claimed invention involves or is based on a specific named marine organism.\nOur purpose in this section has been to introduce a reader new to patent statistics for biodiversity and marine organisms to some of the issues that are involved in constructing and interpreting patent counts. Using this basic guide, our aim is to progressively narrow the scope of analysis to organisms from BBNJ in a transparent way.\n\n\nMarine Organisms\nFollowing a similar approach to that used for the scientific literature, we can use OBIS data to impose a set of filters on the patent data. Figure 48 displays the results of filtering the data onto taxonomic names that are only recorded in a marine environment according to the available data in OBIS (the ‘marine only’ grouping used in the analysis of the scientific literature). The data is also filtered to exclude model organisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 48: Rankings of first filings for marine only organisms and patent claims\nFigure 48 reveals that applying this filter removes some of the major model organisms and research tools such as S. cerevisiae from the rankings thus improving the resolution of the data. Note, however, that in the process we will lose examples where a strain of such organisms were collected from a marine environment. We are, however, with the possible exception of some of the fungi in the list, more clearly in the territory of marine organisms through the application of this filter.\nFigure 49 presents an overview of first filings for organisms that have been reported only in a marine environment in OBIS data. We see a rising trend peaking at approximately 1,145 filings in 2017 before the start of what could potentially be a declining trend before the data meets the usual data cliff in the availability of priority data. Note also that the inclusion of the declining data from 2017 onwards brings down the fit of the trend line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 49: Trends in first filings for marine only organisms (Applicants data excludes individuals).\nFigure 50 displays global trends in demand linked to first filings in the form of demand for protection in multiple markets around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 50: Trends in global family members for marine only organisms (Applicants data excludes individuals).\nIn considering Figure 50 we can observe that activity has narrowed in terms of overall levels of activity to less than 15,000 publications per year and that both the relative country rankings and the applicants involved in global level activity have begun to shift.\n\n\nABNJ Organisms\nWe can go a step further by refining this data to species that have been recorded in ABNJ in OBIS occurrence data. Figure 51 displays the rankings of marine organisms that have been recorded in ABNJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 51: Rankings of first filings for ABNJ organisms\nFigure 52 displays an overview of trends in activity for organisms that have been recorded in ABNJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 52: Rankings of first filings for ABNJ organisms (Applicants data excludes individuals).\nIn considering Figure 52, note that activity is less than 500 filings per year and is concentrated in Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology. Data on applicants is also beginning to shift with companies such as Novozymes rather dramatically falling in the rankings based on first filings. A similar picture also begins to emerge with respect to global demand for protection in Figure 53.\nAn important feature of patent data is that companies may rise and fall over time. An example of this is Solazyme (not shown) with 218 first filings recorded in the data for ABNJ organisms and 191 family members worldwide. Solazyme was founded in 2003 and went on to develop a range of products from plants and algae, notably fuels and, as TerraVia, later refocused on personal products before going bankrupt in 2017. As such, companies may rise and fall in the patent system with intellectual property assets either no longer being maintained through the payment of fees or sold to other companies as part of the liquidation of company assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 53: Rankings of Patent Family Members for ABNJ organisms (Applicants data excludes individuals).\n\n\nABNJ Only\nWe can narrow the focus further to those organisms recorded in OBIS as only occurring in ABNJ as set out in Figure 54. At this level we observe the prominence of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) which is found in consumer products containing krill oil, the copepod Gaussia princeps which is reported to be used as a source of an important luciferase (Tannous et al. (2005)), the Bryozoan Bugula neritina as a source of polyketides (Zhao et al. (2019)) , the red seabream Pagrus major which is used in food, and the deep sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris which is a source of an important luciferase (Inouye et al. (2000). As we might expect, the ABNJ organisms are almost exclusively animals (with the notable exception of the fungi Cladosporium herbarum discussed below). However, at low frequencies we observe references to diatoms such as Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii in claimed inventions for controlling greenhouse gas emissions, conversion of biomass to bioenergy (e.g. US20110201064A1) and diatom based vaccines (US20150037370A1 ). Other chromists mentioned in patent documents, albeit at low frequency, include the marine ciliate Mesodinium rubrum notably in connection with the culture of the plankton Dinophysis accuminata and removal of harmful algal blooms along with inventions claiming to control the fish parasite Miamiensis avidus (e.g. US20100105928A1). References to bacteria are limited on the species level, perhaps reflecting the difficulty of taxonomic identification at this level, with Caminibacter profundus isolated from the mid-Atlantic ridge as an exception in a claimed invention for heat-stable carbonic anhydrases (US8945826B2 and see below).7\nWhen ranked in terms of the appearance of an organism in the claims of patent documents other species begin to become prominent such as the cold water shrimp Pandalus borealis which is used both as a food and as a source of an enzyme alkaline phosphatase and the commercially important compound chitosan from the skeleton of shrimps for medical use. Other species of interest, although perhaps not likely to be from ABNJ, include the giant clam Hippopus hippopus which has a low frequency in terms of the number of filings but a higher frequency in appearing in patent claims in relation to a semisynthetic powder composition from modifying natural biomaterial and a primer kit for identifying clams (EP3673926B1). The north Atlantic copepod Calanus finmarchicus appears in patent claims in relation to sources of Omega-3, antihypertensive food ingredients, antimicrobial compositions from copepods (US8647676B2), its use as a treatment for ectoparasites in fish (US8057809B2) and copepod oil compositions, suggesting a quite wide range of actual and potential uses of this organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 54: Overview of ABNJ Only Organisms in Patent Filings and Patent Claims\nTurning now to trends in activity, Figure 55 reveals that filing activity involving marine organisms that may exist only in ABNJ is typically under 150 filings per year. Taking into account that the classification of ABNJ only organisms is dependent on the accuracy of OBIS data, in reality trends are likely to be somewhat lower than this already limited activity suggests. Nevertheless, while activity is limited there is a rising trend overall, bearing in mind the lag time with more recent data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 55: Overview of Trends for ABNJ Only Organisms in Patent Filings\nFigure 56 displays overall global demand for patent protection linked to the first filings above. Again we observe a rising trend peaking at around 1,200 publications of applications and grants referencing these species globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 56: Overview of Global Demand for Patent Protection involving ABNJ only organisms\n\n\nRefining using Occurrence Records\nThe analysis of the ABNJ Only group presented above in Figure 54 reveals the prominence of the common fungus Cladosporium herbarum which ranks first in activity. Cladosporium herbarum is widely distributed and is found in marine environments. Mohamed and Ibrahim (2021) have recently highlighted that marine associated Cladosporium herbarum are a focus of interest for secondary metabolites with a total of 286 compounds of interest identified in the literature published between 1998 and 2021 (Mohamed and Ibrahim (2021). However, given the wide distribution of this organism, in the absence of other evidence it is unclear if the Cladosporium herbarum in the patent data relates to samples collected in ABNJ or, as is more likely, inside national jurisdictions.\nOne approach to this challenge is to identify a proxy metric that can assist with filtering the data. In the present research we have used a working ‘ABNJ only’ grouping of organisms identified using an OBIS snapshot based on recorded occurrences of an organism outside national jurisdiction. The use of occurrence records in definitional exercises offers a potential metric for assessing the status of an organism as belonging inside or outside an ABNJ grouping, that is occurrence counts. Table 7 displays the organisms within the ABNJ only group ranked by the number of occurrence records in ABNJ using the data from OBIS.\nTable 7: The ABNJ Only grouping ranked on occurrence records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: The tail of the ABNJ Only grouping ranked on occurrence records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, this dataset has a long tail of organisms with limited occurrence records in ABNJ (Table 8). Only 1,161 organisms of all ranks (binomial or uninomial) possess more than 100 occurrence records. In the specific case of Cladosporium herbarum there are 9 occurrence records in ABNJ for this widely distributed fungi. One important challenge with using occurrence records as a metric for filtering ABNJ organisms is that some organisms will have very few occurrence records, this is particularly likely for organisms that are relatively new to science. As such, the use of occurrence counts could exclude rare but important organisms in ABNJ. A potential route to address this would be to use the full GBIF species occurrence dataset to determine the balance of distribution to create a weighted score for organisms that are more likely to be from ABNJ.\nFor the present we will display the data for organisms with ten or more occurrence records in ABNJ. Figure 57. This reduces the data to 257 binomial names. Because patent applicants may use higher order taxonomic ranks in patent claims, we include counts for uninomial names in patent claims (US, EP and Patent Cooperation Treaty documents).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 57: Overview of ABNJ Only Organisms in Patent Filings and Patent Claims (refined)\nFigure 58 displays trends in first filings for the refined set of ABNJ only organisms. This reveals that while there is a rising trend in first filings there are under 40 filings per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 58: Overview of Trends for ABNJ Only Organisms in Patent Filings (refined on occurrence counts)\nFigure 59 sets out trends in global demand for protection based on the first filings in Figure 58.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 59: Overview of Global Demand for Patent Protection involving ABNJ only organisms (refined on occurrence counts)\nAn interesting feature of the ABNJ refined grouping is that Universities, public research organisations and governments become more prominent in the data. For the University of California we observe activity in relation to the claimed potential use of the Gaussia luc luciferase enzyme from the copepod Gaussia princeps as part of an invention that claims to provide a treatment for the genetic neurological disorder known as Angelman Syndrome (WO2021035181A1). A second application made jointly with Dainton Biosciences makes extensive reference to the use of the Gaussia luc luciferase as part of an invention for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (WO2020190970A1). The focus of the invention is a small-molecule inhibitor of pathogenic a-synuclein activity and the Gaussia luciferase is mentioned as a luciferase that can be used in a method for identifying a compound along with a luciferase from the deep sea bioluminescent shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris. While the luciferases are not the central focus of the invention it demonstrates the broader importance of luciferases from the marine environment. A novel application concerning Diatom Based Vaccines was filed by the University of California and Synaptic Research in 2011 that claims a diatom comprising an antigen that is heterologous to the diatom or mixed with or attached to the diatom. In this case the focus appears to be on the use of the diatom as a delivery vehicle for antigens with a range of diatoms mentioned on the family level with Thalassiosira pseudonana (the first marine phytoplankton to be sequenced) as the preferred diatom with the ABNJ located diatom Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii appearing in the description (WO2013063388A1). However, this novel approach does not appear to have resulted in a significant patent family worldwide beyond a patent grant in the United States. This suggests the applicants did not move the claimed invention into production. However, the patent document is cited by 5 later filings and the wider scientific literature suggests significant interest in the use of diatoms in vaccinology among other fields of application.8\nFilings by Harvard University follow a similar pattern to the University of California in so far that most references appear to be to luciferases originating from marine organisms, including in long lists of organisms in the description sections of key CRISPR technology patent filings. Other marine organisms such as Metridia longa and Metridia pacifica also appear in filings from MIT but are not a focus of the invention. In practice, a significant number of patent documents appear in the ABNJ only refined set purely through reference to luciferases from the marine organisms, commonly appearing in a list. An exception involves patent filings from CNRS including filings for antimicrobial peptides from the deep sea worm Alvinella pompejana (WO2011076605A1) and a subsequent filing involving some of the same inventors in connection with the marine worm Capitella, notably the new species Capitella capitata, that appears to have been collected from the fishing village of Roscoff in Brittany, France rather than ABNJ (WO2023111294A1).\nThis brief survey of patent activity for the refined set of ‘ABNJ only’ organisms in patent document exposes the reality that marine organisms may be referenced in patent documents without involving any form of direct collection by applicants (e.g.known luciferases) and also that it is more likely than not that an organism is sourced from inside the EEZ. These brief examples also expose that the presence of named places in patent documents is central to the ability to determine whether an organism originates from ABNJ. We now turn to sequences appearing in marine data.\n\n\nSequences in Patent Data\nThe appearance of DNA and amino acid sequences from marine organisms in patent data has become an increasing focus of attention in the scientific literature (Arnaud-Haond, Arrieta, and Duarte (2011), Blasiak et al. (2018), Oldham, Shale, and Kindness (2019), Oldham and Kindness (2020), Zhivkoplias (2024)). However, sequence data connected with patents requires considerable care both with respect to the raw data and with regard to methods for counting patent documents. The adoption of the BBNJ Agreement signifies that it will be important to establish some form of consensus on patent counts for digital sequence information in patent data and to identify and address the methodological challenges this will involve.\nOne important challenge for analysis has been access to sequence data. Previous work focused on the analysis of data based on sequence listings from the Patent Cooperation Treaty made available by the WIPO secretariat (Arnaud-Haond, Arrieta, and Duarte (2011), Blasiak et al. (2018), Oldham (2014), Oldham and Kindness (2020)). More recent work has expanded the analysis to include sequence data from the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the European Patent Office, the USPTO, the Japan Patent Office and Korean Intellectual Property Office to build the MABPAT database Zhivkoplias et al. (2023).\nThe Lens Patent database is an open access database established by the non-profit CAMBIA in Australia with a specialist focus on biology. The Lens has annotated patent records that contain sequences and established the PatSeq facility containing 495,855,757 sequences associated with patent documents. Sequence data in PatSeq is linked to the public patent interface and metadata for sequences is available through the Lens Patent API. A significant advantage of the Lens sequence data is the significant investments that have been made in identifying sequence information and metadata on organisms in sequence listings.9\nWe downloaded all patent documents containing sequence listings for the period 1975 to June 2024 from the Lens and limited the data to 918,793 publications for January 1975 to December 2023 to establish a sensible cut off point. Raw patent publication data from patent databases is not normally grouped by patent families. As a result it will not reflect the full portfolio of patent documents worldwide (family members) that are linked to a filing or set of filings. Furthermore, existing analysis does not focus on establishing reproducible patent counts using methods that are widely used by patent offices and statistical bodies. To address this we focused on federating (joining) the Lens patent publication data with the EPO World Patent Statistical Database PATSTAT (spring 2024 edition). This approach has the advantage of providing access to INPADOC family data as the basis for establishing counts of trends in first filings of applications and global activity in follow on filings (family members). As such, a route is provided to transparent and reproducible descriptive patent statistics for sequence related activity.\nHowever, it is important to bear in mind that PATSTAT is a snapshot of global patent activity that is released every six months and may be incomplete compared with data sources such as the Lens (which updates patent data on a weekly basis). Therefore we should expect a lag time in the availability of publication data in PATSTAT compared with sources such as the Lens. There may also be issues relating to data coverage of patent offices where PATSTAT is based on the central EPO DOCDB database. In total, we mapped 903,251 of the 918,793 patent publications containing sequences into PATSTAT with 15,309 presently missing. Analysis revealed that the majority of missing records fall in the period 2022 to 2023. Missing records are likely to be picked up in future editions of PATSTAT. However, in future further exploration will be merited to identify records that may be truly missing from PATSTAT. The taxonomic information in sequence data predominantly uses the NCBI taxonomy which lacks taxonomic authority. In order to address this we mapped the raw taxonomic names across to GBIF by extracting uninomial and binomial names.\nIn total, across all data between 1990 and 2021 we identified 30,695 taxonomic and related names in the sequence data including common model organisms. By far the most prominent terms in terms of counts of patent families was ‘unknown/artificial’ (210,945 patent families), Homo sapiens (77,103 families) and Mus musculus (18,059 families). As with the data discussed above, we removed common model organisms from the analysis. We then restricted the data to our OBIS marine only grouping. The top taxonomic names for the ‘marine only’ grouping are presented in Figure 60.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 60: Overview of Marine Only Organisms Appearing in Patent Sequence Data\nWe identified a total of 1,833 taxonomic names in this grouping appearing in 3,571 patent families and 17,097 patent publications worldwide. Trends in activity for the marine only groupings are presented in Figure 61.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 61: Overview of Activity for Marine Only Organisms in Patent Sequence Listings\nIn considering these results, as we might expect the top results are dominated by Vibrio cholerae followed by Aequorea victoria (the bioluminescent jellyfish) and the fungus Trichoderma harzianum discussed above. Note however that the number of first filings of patent families is relatively low and exhibits a peak of 219 filings in 2017 in the data to 2021. Figure 61 clearly demonstrates that there is a rising trend in the filing of patent applications that contain marine organisms in sequence listings. However, the number of filings is relatively modest and has remained modest over time when compared with other areas of patent activity.\nAs we filter the data to the ‘ABNJ’ grouping of organisms we identified a total of 649 taxonomic names in 1,793 INPADOC families with 8,311 family member publications worldwide (Figure 62).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 62: ABNJ Organisms in Patent Sequence Listings\nAs we move into the ABNJ grouping in sequence listings we observe the emergence of the abundant marine cyanobacteria Trichodesmium erythraeum, the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum (originally isolated in a coal refuse heap) and Psychroflexus torquis originally isolated from Antarctic sea ice along with the hydrocarbon degrading Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus and the deep sea bacterium Zunongwangia profunda (Bowman et al. (1998), Qin et al. (2010)). As this suggests, access to sequence data while narrowing our view significantly, can also enrich the analysis by exposing novel organisms.\nFinally, the sequence data for the ‘ABNJ only’ grouping of organisms narrows the data further as set out in Figure 63 and consisted of 256 taxonomic names in 376 INPADOC patent families linked to 1,824 family member publications worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 63: ABNJ Only Organisms in Patent Sequence Listings\nFigure 63 reveals that trends in first filings are now in the region of ~30 per year and fluctuate significantly from year to year. The top ranking species in the sequence listings in this data are the copepod Gaussia princeps, followed by the bioluminescent deep sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris, the sea sponge Suberites domuncula and the red seabream Pagrus major and the fungus Cladosporium herbarum.\nIn this section we have reviewed patent activity for marine organisms that appear in the sequence listings of patent documents using data from the Lens database. Metadata on sequences has only recently been made available by the Lens to contribute to policy analysis and we believe will offer a more complete view of sequence data in patents than is available elsewhere. However, in closing this analysis it is important to emphasise the strengths and weaknesses of the use of sequence data for the analysis of commercial research involving organisms from ABNJ.\nThe first issue of note, as emphasised by Zhivkoplias et. al. (2023) is that sequence listings, notably from the USPTO, may lack data on organisms requiring the use of BLAST to identify organisms. The Lens appears to have made the investments necessary to overcome this problem but this merits further clarification with them. PatSeq also offers the ability to identify whether a sequence appears in the description or claims section of a document but this data does not appear to presently be available except for subscribers. Further discussion is therefore desirable to identify opportunities to improve the resolution of information on trends in sequence activity available to policy makers.\nA third issue, as emphasised by Jefferson et. al. (2015) is the difficulty of interpreting the presence of sequences in patent documents (Jefferson et al. (2013), Jefferson et al. (2015)). That is, sequences may appear because they are used for reference purposes or may be used in examples or appear in the patent claims. However, even where a sequence appears in the patent claims care is required in interpreting whether a sequence is actually being claimed as part of the invention.\nA fourth issue is taxonomic name resolution. There are multiple dimensions to this. First, the resolution of taxonomic names across datasets presents some challenges, notably the need to clean the taxonomic names arising from the sequence listings and then map from the NCBI taxonomy across to GBIF. Second, taxonomic names for the same organism change over time. Third, within patent documents themselves patent claims are often constructed at a higher order taxonomic level such as the genus or family. This presents a challenge for mapping across from sequence listings to patent data that requires text mining of patent data.\nFifth, existing analysis has sought to emphasise that patent activity involving marine organisms is increasing albeit from a low level of activity. This is indeed the case, but a comparison between text mining based analysis using named entity recognition (NER) and sequence listing based analysis reveals that sequence based analysis provides a partial view of wider activity. Thus, in the earlier analysis the “marine only” grouping consisted of 3,944 taxonomic names in 16,759 INPADOC patent families linked to 137,623 patent publications worldwide. In contrast, for sequence data the same measure revealed 1,833 taxonomic names in 3,571 INPADOC families and 14,196 patent family members. As such, analysis of sequences is a subset of the wider landscape for marine genetic resources in patent data.\nIn the context of the BBNJ Treaty it is desirable to improve the visibility of marine genetic resources in patent data and to clarify and define methodologies that link to existing standard approaches. For this reason we have focused on the use of PATSTAT as the gold standard for the elaboration of patent statistics. However, as we have also seen, the analysis of marine genetic resources in patent data involves engagement both with patent texts and sequence listings. Further methodological development and the adoption of a common standard for elaborating counts could contribute to promoting transparency to inform policy debates among Parties.10\nA fundamental issue exposed by all methods such as text mining based name entity recognition or sequence analysis is that taxonomic information is too uncertain as a determining factor in identifying activity in BBNJ. The reason for this is that in the absence of other data points it is not possible to know with certainty where an organisms was collected from ABNJ or not. We now turn to the analysis of named places in patent data in order to improve the resolution of the analysis.\n\n\nPatent Activity for Named Places in ABNJ\nPatent data provides a potentially rich source of information on the geographic origin of organisms involved in a claimed invention. In marked contrast with the scientific literature, the full texts of patent publications are now increasingly being made available for patent research and text mining. The combined provisions of the BBNJ Treaty on the BBNJ standardised batch identifier and the new WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge are likely to contribute to enhanced transparency on the geographic origins of marine organisms appearing in patent data.\nBuilding on the previous work in Valuing the Deep, and consistent with the approach used for the scientific literature, we text mined the full texts of patent documents containing marine organism names for marine feature terms and place names from the GEBCO Gazetteer, Geonames undersea names and the InterRidge vents dataset as well as names for the world’s oceans and the terms deep sea and high seas. This resulted in a working set of 1,159,026 sentences in a total of 380,247 patent documents. A characteristic feature of patent data is that individual documents contain many repeated sentences and those sentences are then repeated as the same document is republished. This leads to a very high level of repetition within and across patent documents in a patent family. We therefore focused on removing repetition and concentrating on sentences associated with one of the ABNJ grouping or organisms. Many individual feature terms from GEBCO such as “pass”, “rise” and “plateau” as well as place names such as “old woman”, King”, “Kingston” and “banks” including phrases such as “black hole”, “cats claw”, “horses head”, “zone b” and “banks 1” proved to be spectacularly noisy and suggests that greater consideration should be given to linguistic distinctiveness when naming underwater places in the deep oceans.\nBuilding on the experience gained from Valuing the Deep we focused attention on deduplicating records and iteratively refining the review to arrive at records containing a valid place name while avoiding, to the extent possible, repetition of the results. A key issue encountered in the course of reviewing the sentences is that many references are generic in nature in referring to the general distribution of organisms (e.g. in an ocean). References to the collection of an organism from a specific place are relatively limited. For example, an applicant may make reference to enzymes that function above 100C at terrestrial hot springs or deep sea hydrothermal vents but no named place is provided. Even where a named place is provided this does not necessarily mean that the applicant went to collect samples on site. In other words, identifying clear evidence of collection of a marine organism from a named place either inside or outside ABNJ is a challenging task. Furthermore, where clear evidence was provided of collection in a named place it was more likely to be inside national jurisdiction or in a wider area falling into multiple national jurisdictions, notably the Caribbean Basin or locations around The Bahamas.\nValuing the Deep developed a basic typology of patent references to places, these were:\n\nSamples isolated from named locations e.g. East Manus Basin\nSamples from broad geographical areas e.g. The Atlantic, the Pacific Ocean, Mid-Atlantic Ridge\nSpecific collection locations e.g. including coordinates\nAcquired through a third party. e.g. DeepVent or commercial luciferases\nUnspecified location habitat locations e.g. a hydrothermal vent\n\nThis broad typology continues to hold true even as our ability to interrogate and compile data by geographic locations has improved. Figure 64 shows a summary of the findings for named places falling inside and outside the EEZ. References to generic locations such as ‘the Atlantic’, ‘the North Atlantic’ and so on are common in the data and for these entries we aggregate up to one location (e.g. Atlantic Ocean). The counts in this diagram are of individual patent publications rather than being grouped by patent families (which will lead to lower counts). The reason for this is that we are focusing on identifying names in specific documents and the parent document in the patent family may not always contain the marine place name. We have attempted to remove duplicate sentences from the same document. However, where more than one document contains the same sentence (which is likely with family members), the sentence has been retained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 64: Overview of Patent Places in the Description Sections of Patent Documents\nIn considering Figure 64 we have chosen to display a selection of sentences from across the data that illustrates some of the issues involved in identifying activity from BBNJ. In some cases, such as line one in the Texts panel there is clear evidence of the collection of a sponge specimen using gardening shears from a named reef. It then needs to be determined whether Inner Fsar Reef falls inside the EEZ or is in ABNJ (Inner Fsar reef is in the Red Sea and therefore inside the EEZ). In this specific case, coordinates are also provided. However, in our experience reviewing patent documents this is very rare and coordinates may also be expressed in varying forms.\nThe second line in the Texts panel illustrates that oceans and seas may be a focus of attention for other reasons. In line 2 we find a reference to CO2 being transported into North Sea oil fields where it is to be used for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).11 That is, we should expect to see a significant amount of activity focusing on the oil and gas industry. This case is an example of noise in the marine patent dataset (as there is nothing biological in this application). However, other applications involving CO2 involve proposed iron fertilization projects in places such as the Iceland Basin or Shag Rocks in the Weddell Sea (US20180079669A1). While other speculative inventions involve carbon sequestration through coalification of organic matter at hydrothermal vents (US11414962B2). We also observed a surprising increase in references to the benefits of deep sea water for claimed health and other purposes for example, the use of deep sea water in a method for cultivating coffee beans that makes reference to sea water from the upwelling of the Pacific into the East Sea (US10575480B2). In other cases we identified filings in connection with artificial reefs from specialist companies such as Enconcete Tech (e.g. WO2014125493A1).\nA full decade on from the last exercise of this type in the Valuing the Deep study, there continues to be limited direct evidence of the collection of organisms from named places in the world’s oceans that are then submitted for patent protection. A possible exception is the references to marine places in sequence listings. However, in those cases it becomes necessary to determine whether the reference is illustrative and whether the sequence plays a role in the patent claims.\nThe limited nature of the results for named places in ABNJ is not in fact surprising. However, and reflecting the outcomes of Valuing the Deep, we would note that promoting disclosure of the origin of marine genetic resources from ABNJ would be worthwhile for the purpose of demonstrating the contribution of the biodiversity of the world’s oceans to human welfare and well-being. The provisions of the High Seas Treaty and the recently concluded WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, have an important potential contribution to make in enhancing the visibility of genetic resources in patent data from the world’s deep oceans as does the work of researchers focused on sequence data. Finally, the recent decision by the INSDC to require location information as well as the increasing use of BioSample database templates also have an important role to play in improving transparency.\n\n\nPatent Places in Detail\n\nIron Fertilization (Climate Change)\nThe top ranking patent filing for marine places in terms of references to a range of different underwater places is a filing for a method for selecting the appropriate location for iron fertilization (US20180079669A1) which makes reference, among other places to the Iceland Basin and Shag Rocks in the Weddell Sea and was filed in 2017 by a company called G Land with a single inventor Kim Tai-Jin.12 The patent application has only two family members (one in the United States and the second a PCT filing) suggesting that this is not being pursued in multiple countries and has not resulted in a patent grant.\n\n\nDetecting Environmental Contamination\nThe second ranked set in relation to underwater places is a US application from the University of California that focuses on methods for detecting the source of fecal bacterial contamination in samples using microarray probe hybridization (US20140200149A1). The patent application discloses a total of 1,058 different bacterial taxa that appear in fecal matter and can be used to identify fecal matter in water using a phylogenetic microarray to identify multiple sources of contamination in one test. The patent application makes reference to a bacterial clone from soil in the Ross Sea area of Antarctica (EU009752.1) as well as a bacterial clone from a hydrothermal vent at the Juan de Fuca Ridge (EU555133.1) and provides the relevant accession numbers. The patent family consists of four members and contains two US patent grants. However, the focus of the invention is on “a method for detecting the source of fecal bacteria contamination in an environmental sample” based on whether the taxa listed in tables in the description appear in certain percentages in a sample. As such, the ABNJ sample bacterial clone is one among many others that are incorporated into the claimed method. Other uses of the clone outside the method (which is broadly constructed) are unlikely to be affected by this type of claim. This example is useful for two reasons. First, it illustrates that a reference to a place in ABNJ (soil from the Ross Sea region) may in fact be from a terrestrial source. Second, it illustrates that the use of an organism in a patent claim does not necessarily involve a per se claim over the organism or its components.\n\n\nAnticancer Agents\nA 2017 PCT filing originating from Rutgers University focuses on ceramide derivatives as anticancer agents (WO2017015301A1) and states that:\n\n“Bathymodiolus azoricus was collected using the deep submergence vehicle DSVAIvin from an active hydrothermal vent along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Region: North, Location: Lucky Strike (LS), Dive Number 3119, Date: July 09, 1997, Latitude: 37 17.394 N, Longitude: 32 16.672 W, Depth: 1,721 m) and identified by …”\n\nThe patent filing claims both a compound originating from the organism (Bathymodiolamide) and a method of obtaining it. The filing has resulted in a single patent grant in the United States in 2020 and has not, on the available evidence, been pursued elsewhere (US10537545B2).\n\n\nCeramide Derivatives\nThis recent patent family was filed in 2016 by Rutgers University and focuses on ceramide derivatives as anticancer agents (US10537545B2, WO2017015301A1).13 The patent claims synthesized ceramide derivatives which share the same structure as natural compounds derived from Bathymodiolus thermophilic and possibly from Bathymodiolus azoricus, which are implicated in triggering apoptosis, or cell death. The claimed intention is to use these synthetic compounds for anti-cancer purposes in animals including humans. However, this is a composition of matter filing and the applicants do not show the synthesis of the compounds.\nThe background section of the patent records the collection and testing of the above organisms from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is an Area Beyond National Jurisdiction, including the date, co-ordinates, and the location where a voucher specimen is kept:\n\n“Animal Material. Bathymodiolus thermophilic was collected using the deep submergence vehicle DSVAlvin from an active hydrothermal vent along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Region: North, Location: Lucky Strike (LS), Dive Number 3120, Date: July 10, 1997, Latitude: 37° 17.63’ N, Longitude: 32° 16.53’ W, Depth: 1,733 m) and identified by Dr. R. C. Vrijenhoek (Department of Genetics, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey) and DR. C. Vetriani ( IMCS, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey). A voucher specimen is available at the Center for Marine Biotechnology, IMCS, Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 with collection number AD-MUS-LS-7/10/97.”\n\n\n“Given the biodiversity of invertebrate mussels at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, another species of mussel from a deep-sea vent was also extracted and tested. Bathymodiolus azoricus was collected using the deep submergence vehicle DSVAIvin from an active hydrothermal vent along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Region: North, Location: Lucky Strike (LS), Dive Number 3119, Date: July 09, 1997, Latitude: 37° 17.394’ N, Longitude: 32° 16.672’ W, Depth: 1,721 m) and identified by Dr. R. C. Vrijenhoek (formerly of the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey) and Dr. C. Vetriani (Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey). A voucher specimen is available at the Center for Deep-Sea Ecology and Biotechnology, Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 with collection number AD-MUS-LS- 7/09/97.”\n\nThe voucher specimens are kept by Rutgers University. Rutgers is also listed as the applicant on the patent documents, suggesting a linkage between the collection and testing of the specimens, and the development of the ceramide derivatives for anti-cancer purposes. This seems to be a case in which there is an evident link between the collection of a genetic resource in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction and the use of knowledge about that organism for patent purposes. The actual or potential synthesis of ceramides based on naturally derived ceramides from Bathymodiolus thermophilic also highlights the ways in which genetic resources can be used in synthetic biology. The actual or potential synthesis of natural compounds must therefore be caught in depictions of value flows.\n\n\nCancer Drugs\nPharma Mar is a Spanish company specialising in research and innovation using marine genetic resources.14 Patent application US20090124647A1 filed in 2006 focuses on Indole derivatives as antitumour compounds that are obtainable from a tunicate in the family Polyclinidae, genus Aplidium and species cyaneum and its derivatives. The description section of the application explains that:\n\n“[0053] Compounds I-VI were isolated from a tunicate, of the family Polyclinidae, genus Aplidium, species cyaneum. Two samples of the specimen were deposited in the Department of Environmental Sciences (Marine Biology Unit) of the University of Alicante (Spain) with the following reference codes: ASC.ANT.EQ.433-1 and ASC.ANT.EQ.1097-1. This tunicate was collected by bottom trawling in Weddell Sea (Longitude: −10.533333, Latitude: −71.933333) at a depth ranging between 220 and 300 m, and its description is the following:\n\n\n[0054] Aplidium cyaneum, also known as Aplidium caeruleum, is distributed at the circum-Antarctic in waters of the continental shelf and slope from 75 down to about 1000 meters. Colonies are usually upright, club-shaped. There may be 2 lobes or heads from a single base, or in particularly wide colonies there may be 2 inverted cone-shaped bases supporting a widely spreading upper part of the colony. Height of colonies generally about 4 cm…”\n\nIn this case we can clearly see the origin of the organism and the source of the sample used by the applicants (the University of Alicante). Significant detail is also provided on the organism and its habitat. In terms of the patent claims the document claims “A compound of general formula …” that is extracted and isolated from Aplidium cyaneum.\nThe US application forms part of a patent family with 12 members filed through WO2007054748A1 and with regional and national filings at the European Patent Office, Norway, South Korea, China, Japan, the US and Russia. However, the US filing appears to be discontinued as of April 2011 and we were not able to clearly identify a granted patent in this family. However, the filing is cited by four later US patent grants awarded to Pharma Mar for antitumoral compounds (US11713325B2, US10538535B2, US11339180B2, US11332480B2) involving some of the same inventors. This suggests that the original US filing has provided a platform for subsequent filings. The later filings do not make reference to Aplidium cyaneum or to Aplidium but do make reference to Aplidine (also known as plitidepsin), a compound that appears to be derived from Aplidium albicans. According the PharmaMar website:\n\n“Plitidepsin is extracted from the ascidian Aplidium albicans which to our knowledge is exclusively found in the waters of Es Vedrà. This marine invertebrate is found at a depth of around 40-50 meters.”15\n\nAccording to Pharma Mar, Es Vedrà is an island located 2 kilometres from Ibiza and is therefore inside the EEZ of Spain. Aplidin (as plitidepsin) was approved as an orphan drug for acute lymphoblastic leukemia by the European Medicines Authority. However, authorisation was later refused for its use for treating multiple myeloma and, following a successful appeal, is now under review.16\n\n\nAquaculture\nPatent grant US7404377B2 awarded to Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan focuses on methods for rearing, cultivating or stocking crustacea that involves drawing seawater from depths of 350-700 meters containing specific ranges of bacteria to feed crustacea living at depths of less than 250 metres. The patent family consists of three members and protection has only been pursued in Japan and the United States.\n\n\nPhylogenetic Analysis\nA European Patent grant EP2446062B1 from 2014 awarded to the University of California makes reference to an ‘East Pacific Rise seafloor clone’ but focuses on a single assay based system for the identification of operational taxonomic units in a claimed invention focused on methods and systems for phylogenetic analysis. The claims make reference to a range of different probes for use in the claimed invention. The European patent grant form part of a wider patent family with 13 members including filings in Singapore, Canada, and Japan. This suggests that the claimed invention is important to the applicants.\n\n\nBioreactors\nA 2019 patent grant to the Carnegie Institution of Washington provides for a High Pressure Bioreactor (US10280393B2)17 and refers to:\n\n“… an integrated system, apparatus and method that allows for the continuous culturing of microorganisms under high pressure conditions and at a wide range of temperatures. More specifically, the system is configured to be gas tight and operate under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The system is also configured to permit periodic sampling of the incubated organisms under such conditions with minimal physical/chemical disturbance inside the reactor and minimal impacts of shear forces on the collected biomass.”\n\nThe patent description then goes on to provide examples of the nature and use of the system using diagrams and photographs as illustrated in Figure 65.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 65: A Ship Board Bioreactor\nThe figure is accompanied by the following description:\n\n“[0025] FIG. 10 shows the high-pressure bioreactor deployed onboard the oceanographic vessel R/V Atlantis. Continuous culture experiments of microbial communities collected from deep-sea hydrothermal vents were conducted at in-situ seafloor pressure (25 MPa) and temperature (30-50° C.) conditions without depressurizing the environmental fluid sample by integrating vent fluid sampling techniques (Isobaric-Gas-Tight sampler, WHOI) (Seewald, J. S., et al. (2002), A new gas-tight isobaric sampler for hydrothermal fluids, Deep-Sea Research, Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers, 49(1), 189-196.) with our high pressure bioreactor. Experiments were designed to study denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) metabolisms under in-situ deep-sea vent temperature and pressure conditions. The hydrothermal vent sites studied (Crap Spa, Tica) are located along the East Pacific Rise at 9° 51′ N and at depth of ˜2500 meters.”\n\nAs the applicants note, the ability to conduct culturing experiments at high pressure has “implications in food science, virus-related research and studies involved in the development of energy resources”. They provide examples of the use of high pressure in the food industry to inactivate microorganisms, the study of antibiotic resistance and the microbial formation of diesel like hydrocarbons and the relationship between microbial life and oil formation in the deep subsurface as well as biodegradation of petroleum. As this suggests, the bioreactor system, which was funded by NSF-OCE Grant Nos. 1038114, 0752221, 1136608, and 1155246, has a wide range of potential applications.\nAs we might expect, the claims for this granted patent focus on “A high pressure bioreactor for the continuous culturing of microorganisms under high pressure…” rather than the marine genetic resources as such. However, what is significant about the range of examples provided is that it makes these experiments and the organisms collected in the course of these experiments mobile.\nThe granted patent forms part of a family with four members (US20170015972A1, US10280393B2 and WO2015131046A2 and WO2015131046A3 as publication of the search report). As such, and as with all granted patents discussed in this section, patent protection will only apply to the jurisdictions where the patent is granted and is in force.\nThe US granted patent has not attracted significant patent citations with two later citations. The first is a 2023 US grant (US11794893B2) to an individual for a transportation system for organic payloads. This is related to a second patent grant relating to transporting material to hydrothermal vents sites for the purposes of carbon sequestration. The second is a grant to the same individual that has been highlighted above for coalification and carbon sequestration using deep ocean hydrothermal borehole vents (US11414962B2). These later patent filings have patent families with 9 or more members.\n\n\nEnzymes\n\nPolymerases\nPolymerases are used to synthesize long chains of nucleic acids and are fundamental in the modern biosciences. Taq DNA polymerase (first isolated from Thermus aquaticus in Mushroom Pool in Yellowstone National Park), and Thermus thermophilus (first isolated at a thermal spa in Izu, Japan), Sulfolobus solfataricus (now Saccharolobus solfataricus) described as originating from the Solfatara volcano in Italy, have played an important role in highlighting the potential of marine organisms in the literature because these organisms were subsequently discovered in marine environments.\nA 2001 filing by Stratagene and Agilent Technologies resulted in a US patent grant (now expired in the US) for ‘a novel isolated Family B DNA polymerase, a Thermococcus polymerase JDF-3, and mutant recombinant forms’ (US8268605B2). The polymerase is claimed as part of “A composition for identifying a nucleotide at a given position of a template DNA molecule”. The description makes clear that “[0246] A Thermococcus species was cultured from submarine samples taken from the Juan de Fuca ridge. Genomic DNA was isolated and used to prepare a genomic DNA library in ZAP II (Stratagene) using standard procedures.” This patent grant has a patent family with 10 members in 6 jurisdictions (including the EP and PCT e.g.) suggesting it was important to the applicants. The claimed invention has also attracted a significant number of citations (64) by later applicants suggesting that claimed invention had a significant impact in limiting the scope of later patent filings in the same or similar fields. This impact is further exposed by the 119 citations attracted by the PCT family member WO2001032887A1. It is unclear why a 2001 filing was only published as a patent grant in 2012.\nA 2002 patent application (US20020013455A1) and grant (US6492511B2) by Verenium corporation for the Isolation and Identification of Novel Polymerases and explains that:\n\n“The present invention provides purified thermostable enzymes that catalyze DNA synthesis by addition of deoxynucleotides to the 3′ end of a polynucleotide chain, using a complementary polynucleotide strand as a template. An exemplary purified enzyme is a polymerase derived from an organism referred herein as “Ammonifex degensii KC4” is a gram negative, chemolithoautotrophic eubacteria and has a very high temperature optimum. Ammonifex degensii KC4 was discovered in a deep sea isolate from the Middle Atlantic Ridge. Ammonifex degensii KC4 grows optimally at 70° C. and pH 7.0 in a low salt medium. This exemplary enzyme is shown in FIG. 1.[00027] The polynucleotide encoding SEQ ID NO:1 was originally recovered from a genomic gene library derived from Ammonifex degensii KC4 as described below. It contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 867 amino acid residues.”\n\nThe filing and grant are notable for containing 11 sequences, including for Ammonifex degensii. There are 11 documents in the patent family including filings in the US, JP, AU, CA, EP and WO (for the PCT) and the granted patent has been cited 13 times by later filings with the PCT filing cited 28 times (WO1999007837A1), suggesting the wider impact of the claimed invention in this technology space.\nVerenium is significant as a company because it was originally created from the merger of Diversa Inc which features elsewhere in the data for marine organisms and wider landscapes for enzymes and Celunol in a transition to a focus on biofuels. Verenium was later acquired by BASF and reportedly offers enzymes developed through Verenium.\nA 1994 US patent granted to New England Biolabs (US5756334A) focuses on ‘DNA polymerase endogenous to an archaebacterium of the isolate 9°N-7’ and specifies that:\n\n“In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a thermostable enzyme obtainable from isolate 9.degree.N-7 which catalyzes the polymerization of DNA. The thermostable enzymes obtainable from isolate 9.degree.N-7, an archaebacterium isolated from a submarine thermal vent at 9.degree.N, East Pacific Rise about 2500M meters deep, is a DNA polymerase which has a molecular weight about 90-95 kDa, and a preliminarily estimated half-life of about 5-6 hours at 95.degree. C. The DNA encoding 9.degree.N-7 has been isolated and provides the preferred means to obtain this thermostable DNA polymerase.”\n\nThe filing directly claims the thermostable enzyme that it describes. The granted patent is interesting in that it does not have an identifiable patent family outside the United States. However, it has attracted a significant number of citations, including in 2024, (e.g. EP4110952A4 focusing on Pyrococcus Enzymes) suggesting an enduring impact.\n\n\nPolymerases and Nucleotide Analogues\nA 2017 filing by the University of Columbia (US20200069717A1) focuses on nucleotide derivatives and methods of use and resulted in a patent grant in 2022 (US11266673B2). The patent claims: “A method of incorporating a nucleotide analogue into a nucleic acid sequence comprising combining a thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase, a primer hybridized to nucleic acid template, and a nucleotide analogue comprising a detectable label, within a reaction vessel and allowing said thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase to incorporate said nucleotide analogue into said primer thereby incorporating a nucleotide analogue into a nucleic acid sequence”. The claims also list specific formulas for linkers for incorporating the nucleotide analogues.\nIn common with other filings we find language as follows on the Thermococcus N9 polymerase:\n\n“[0207] The term “thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase” as used herein refers to a family of DNA polymerases (e.g., 9° N™) and mutants thereof derived from the DNA polymerase originally isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaea, Thermococcus sp. 9 degrees N-7, found in hydrothermal vents at that latitude (East Pacific Rise) (Southworth M W, et al. PNAS. 1996; 93(11):5281-5285). ”\n\nThe filing forms part of a family with 9 members including filings in China, at the European Patent Convention, the PCT and the US. This relatively young patent family has been cited in a recent patent grant to Singular Genomics (see below) in connection with Methods and compositions for reducing nucleotide impurities (US12031179B2) which also specifies that\n\n“the term “thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase” refers to a family of DNA polymerases (e.g., 9° N) and mutants thereof derived from the DNA polymerase originally isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaea, Thermococcus sp. 9 degrees N-7, found in hydrothermal vents at that latitude (East Pacific Rise) (Southworth M W, et al. PNAS. 1996; 93(11):5281-5285).”\n\nAs we will see in more detail below, a competitive technology space has emerged around polymerases and nucleotide analogs.\n\n\nLigases\nReferences to the East Pacific Rise are among the most prominent in the patent data. This is largely attributable to the Thermococcus strain 9N which was discovered at a hydrothermal vent and is marketed by New England Biolabs as 9°N(tm) DNA Ligase Southworth et al. (1996).18 As observed by Oldham et al (2013), a marked feature of the patent system is that the discovery of the useful properties of an organism can subsequently lead to an intense focus on identifying other properties of the organism and its dissemination across multiple areas of invention (e.g. as an actual or potential ingredient) (Oldham, Hall, and Forero (2013)). This appears to be the case with Thermococcus 9N with the original publication on the enzyme cited in 70 patent families and 126 patent documents (Southworth et al. (1996)). A public collection of these documents is available on The Lens.\nWO2006037064A2 is a Patent Cooperation Treaty filing from Li Cor Inc for mutant polymerases for sequencing and genotyping.19 The application list a range of different ‘native’ polymerases including the following:\n\n“[0067] The native 9°N DNA polymerase is purified from a strain of E.coli that carries a modified 9°N DNA Polymerase gene {see Southworth et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. USA 93:5281-5285) from the extremely thermophilic marine archaea Thermococcus species, strain 9°N-7. The archaea is isolated from a submarine thermal vent, at a depth of 2,500 meters, 9° north of the equator at the East Pacific Rise. The native 90N DNA polymerase has 3’→ 5’ proofreading exonuclease activity. A 90N DNA polymerase sequence is provided in Table 6.\n\n\n[0068] The native TIi DNA polymerase {see Table 6) is derived from the hyperthermophile archaea Thermococcus litoralis. This polymerase (also referred to as Vent® DNA polymerase) is extremely thermostable and contains a 3’→ 5’ exonuclease activity that enhances the fidelity of replication…\n\n\n[0069] Another extremely thermostable native DNA polymerase (also known as Deep Vent® DNA polymerase) {see Table 6) is purified from a strain of E. coli that carries the Deep Vent DNA polymerase gene from Pyrococcus species GB-D (see Xu et al.(1993) Cell 75:1371-1377). The native organism is isolated from a submarine thermal vent at 2010 meters (see Jannasch et al (1992) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:3472-3481) and is able to grow at temperatures as high as 104°C.”\n\nThe focus of the application is on mutant polymerases that “exhibit a faster or slower incorporation kinetics for deoxynucleotide-triphosphates (dNTPs) or phosphate-labeled deoxynucleotide-triphosphate (dNTP) during polymerization of DNA strands in comparison to native DNA polymerases, depending on the method used.” As such it is modifications to existing polymerases that is the focus of attention and in particular they explain that “the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of more than 300 mutant DNA polymerases (SEQ ID NOs: 1-750) derived from a 9°N DNA polymerase, referred to herein as 9°N-A485L polymerase (SEQ ID NO: 2). 9°N -A485L polymerase is identical to the 9°N-Native polymerase (SEQ ID NO: 786) except that the native polymerase includes an alanine (”A”) residue at amino acid position 485, where the polymerase of SEQ ID NO:2 includes a leucine.”\nThis leads them to claim:\n\n“A mutant DNA polymerase, wherein the amino acid sequence of the phosphate region of said mutant DNA polymerase comprises two or more mutations not present in the phosphate region of the most closely related native DNA polymerase, and wherein said two or more phosphate region mutations increase the rate at which said mutant DNA polymerase incorporates a phosphate-labeled nucleotide.”\n\nAs this makes clear, what is being claimed is modifications to existing polymerases. Those polymerases may of course be the subject of patent applications or grants by other applicants (such as New England Biolabs which markets Deep Vent).\nThis patent application is part of a family with six members but does not, as far as we can establish, include a granted patent. However, the application has attracted a significant number of citations by later filings (42 in total) including patent grants to Illumina (US11634697B2), Roche Molecular Systems (US8765435B2), the University of Texas (US10858652B2) and Solexa and Illumina (US11473067B2) in relation to modified polymerases. As this reveals, the citation of a patent filing does not necessarily prevent a subsequent grant but may limit what may be claimed by later applicants as new or novel and involving an inventive step. More importantly, for the present purposes, the modification of polymerases through means such as base substitution brings us into the realms of what is variously called synthetic biology or biological engineering and exposes the reality that the modification of known chemical structures is a major focus of patent activity. For our purposes this also helps to demonstrate that the origin of a compound may progressively disappear from view as part of the process of modification, transformation and renaming.\n\n\nEsterases\nEsterases are industrially important enzymes that break down ester bonds into alcohol and an acid and can be used in biorefinery applications such as biofuels. A late 1990s patent family from Recombinant Biocatalysis Inc (WO1997030160A1) focuses on esterases from newly identified polynucleotides and polypeptides.20 What is striking in this case is that the claimed polynucleotides were derived from multiple sources:\n\n“- The polynucleotides of this invention were originally recovered from genomic gene libraries derived from the following organisms:\n\n\n\nStaphylothermus marinus F 1 is a thermophilic sulfur archaea which was isolated in Vulcano, Italy. It grows optimally at 85°C (Tma- = 98°C) at pH 6.5.\n\n\n\n\nPyrodictium TAG1 1 is a thermophilic sulfur archaea which was isolated in the Middle Atlantic Ridge. It grows optimally at 103°C (Tmax = 110°C) at pH 6.5. Archaeoglobus venificus SNP6 was isolated in the Middle Atlantic Ridge and grows optimally at 75 °C (Tmax = 92 °C) at pH 6.9.\n\n\n\n\nAquifex pyrophilus KOI 5a was isolated at Kolbeinsey Ridge, North of Iceland. This marine organism is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, strictly chemolithoautrophic, knall gas bacterium. It grows optimally at 85°C (Tmax = 95°C) at pH 6.8.\n\n\n\n\nMl ITL is a new species of Desulfurococcus which was isolated from Diamond Pool (formerly Jim’s Black Pool) in Yellowstone. The organism grows heterotrophically by fermentation of different organic materials (sulfur is not necessary) in grape-like aggregates optimally at 85 - 88°C in a low salt medium at pH 7.0.\n\n\n\n\nThermococcus CL-2 was isolated in the North Cleft Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge from a severed alvinellid worm residing on a “black smoker” sulfϊde structure. This marine archaea forms pleomorphic cocci, and grows optimally at 88 °C.\n\n\n\n\nAquifex VF5 was isolated at a beach in Vulcano, Italy. This marine organism is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, strictly chemolithoautotrophic, knall gas bacterium. It grows optimally at 85°C (Tma- = 95°C) at pH 6.8.\n\n\n\n\nTeredinibacter (pure) is an endosymbiont of the shipworm Bankia gouldi. The organism has straight to slightly bent 5-10 μm rods, and forms spiral cells as stationary phase is met. The organism was described in Science (1983) 22: 1401-1403. It grows optimally at 30° C at pH 8.0.\n\n\n\n\nArchaeoglobus fulgidus VClβ was isolated in Vulcano, Italy. The organism grows optimally at 85 °C (Tma, = 92 °C) at pH 7.0.\n\n\n\n\nSulfolobus solfataricus PI grows optimally at 85°C (Tma- = 87°C) at pH 2.0. ccor ng y, t e po ynuc eot es an enzymes enco e t ereby are dent ied by the organism from which they were isolated, and are sometimes hereinafter referred to as F1/12LC (Figure 1 and SEQ ID NOS:23 and 33), TAG11/17LC (Figure 2 and SEQ ID NOS:24 and 34), SNP6/24LC (Figure 3 and SEQ ID NOS:25 and 35), AqP/28LC (Figure 4 and SEQ ID NOS:26 and 36), M11TL/29L (Figure 5 and SEQ ID NOS:27 and 37), CL-2/30LC (Figure 6 and SEQ ID NOS:28 and 38), VF5/34LC (Figure 7 and SEQ ID NOS: 29 and 39), Trb/42L (Figure 8 and SEQ ID NOS: 30 and 40). VC16/16MC (Figure 9 and SEQ ID NOS: 31 and 41) and P1/8LC (Figure 10 and SEQ ID NOS: 32 and 42).” (WO1997030160A1)”\n\n\nWe observe here that there are two ABNJ sources (Pyrodictium TAG1 and Thermococcus CL-2) as well as EEZ and terrestrial aquatic sources (Vulcano and Yellowstone national park which are also the source of famous enzymes from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Thermus aquaticus respectively). The patent application claims:\n\n“1 An isolated polynucleotide comprising a member selected from the group consisting of: (a) a polynucleotide having at least a 70% identity to a polynucleotide encoding an enzyme comprising amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS.33-42…”\n\nAn important point that emerges here is that it becomes necessary to determine the origins of the sequences that are actually being claimed by the applicant. Currently the Lens patent database does not contain the sequences for this application. We are therefore forced to interrogate statements such as:\n\n“Figure 2 is an illustration of the full-length DNA (SEQ ID NO: 24) and corresponding deduced amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:34) of Pyrodictium TAG1 1 - 17LC….\n\n\nFigure 6 is an illustration of the full-length DNA (SEQ ID NO: 28) and corresponding deduced amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:38) of Thermococcus CL-2- 30LC.”\n\nIn this case note that nucleotides fall outside the sequences specified in claim 1 (SEQ IDS 33-42) while the amino acid sequences fall inside the scope of the claims. As this makes clear, claims interpretation requires significant care. It cannot, and should not, be assumed that because a sequence from an organism in ABNJ appears in a patent description that the sequence (or both nucleotide and protein sequences) are claimed.\nThis patent document forms part of a family with 18 members in the main jurisdictions including a European Patent Convention Grant (EP0880590B1 published in 2004 some eight years after the priority filing).\n\n\nPhosphatases\nIn a separate patent family Diversa (which subsequently became Verenium) also filed an application relating to Thermostable phosphatases (EP1488802A2, WO1997048416A1) which also referenced Thermococcus CL-2 from the Juan de Fuca Ridge and adds the detail that ‘Thermococcus CL-2 was isolated from a worm residing on a “black smoker” sulfite structure’.21 The description makes clear that: “The present invention provides thermostable phosphatases from several organisms. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there are provided novel enzymes, as well as active fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof.” The patent claims focus on a polynucleotide selected from a group within the set 54 provided sequences. The application forms part of a patent family with 15 members including a now expired European grant and the translation of the regional level patent into national patents under the European Patent Convention (e.g. DE69731113T2, ATE278416T1) and another grant listed in Australia (AU721570B2). WO1997048416A1 has attracted 39 citations by later filings suggesting a significant impact in the wider technology space.\n\n\nProteases from marine fungi\nA 2003 filing from the Council for Scientific and Industrial research in India (WO2005045047A1) focuses on a process for producing alkaline protease from a deep sea fungus.22 The description describes the origin of the fungus as:\n\n“Present invention relates to a process for production of protease enzyme, using a marine strain of the fungus Aspergillus sp., isolated from deep-sea sediments collected at a depth of ~5000m in the Central Indian basin and deposited in the microbial type culture collection (MTCC) of Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India, under the accession number MTCC 5102.”\n\nThe filing also directly claims the fungus as follows:\n\n“I. A fungus Aspergillus sp. deposited in the Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene bank (MTCC) of Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India, under the accession number MTCC 5102. 2. A fungus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said fungi is: a) a deuteromycete fungus; b) it appears granular, light yellow-green to deep yellow-green in color in malt extract agar plate; c) conidiophores are uni-seriate, conidial heads are globose and echinulate, and d) grows in the sea water and distilled water with carbon and nitrogen source in a pH range of 7.0-9.0 and temperature range of 5° to 30° C.”\n\nAdditional claims focus on the conditions for growing the fungus and a low temperature alkaline protease enzyme produced by the fungus with specific pH ranges.\nThis application forms part of a family of two with a second application in the United States. No patent grants are listed in the family and the application has not attracted citations from later applicants. It is conceivable, as is quite common, that the applicants were using the patent system as a form of shop window with a view to attracting potential investors.\n\n\nAnhydrases\nA 2019 filing by Novozymes focuses on Heat-Stable Metagenomic Carbonic Anhydrases (US20190241881A1) and claims a polypeptide having carbonic anhydrase activity that is useful in a process for extracting carbon dioxide from various carbonates or bicarbonates.\nThe filing explains that: “The present invention relates to polypeptides, identified as a metagenomic sequence isolated from the Logatchev hydrothermal vent, having carbonic anhydrase activity and catalytic domains, and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides and catalytic domains.”\nThe application goes on to explain that: “Example 1 Cloning and Expression of Logatchev Carbonic Anhydrase in B. subtilis The gene of a carbonic anhydrase (referred to as Logatchev CA; DNA shown as SEQ ID NO: 1, and protein shown as SEQ ID NO: 2) was identified as a metagenomic sequence obtained from the Logatchev hydrothermal vent (Perner et al., 2013), Environ. 1”\nThe filing forms part of a family consisting of 9 members including two patent grants in the United States (US10927364B2, US11773386B2), one under the European Patent Convention (EP3487997B1) and one in China (CN109477083B). The filing contains nine sequence listings for nucleotides and peptides, all of which are classified as artificial.\nNovozymes AS has filed a series of documents within the same patent family, comprising two related applications and grants in the US and one pending application within the Patent Co-operation Treaty System.23\nIn a separate patent family Novozymes also filed an application in 2021 with an earliest priority date of 2016 (US2021147823A1). The patent was granted in 2023 (US11773386B2) although claims 1-18 had been cancelled. A separate filing for claims 1-18 had been filed in 2017 (US2019241881A1) which was granted in 2021 (US10927364B2).A 2017 filing under the Patent Co-operation Treaty System (WO2018017792A1) for claims 1-18 is currently pending.\nThe summary of the invention is as follows:\n\n“The present invention relates to polypeptides, identified as a metagenomic sequence isolated from the Logatchev hydrothermal vent, having carbonic anhydrase activity and catalytic domains, and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides and catalytic domains. The invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs, vectors, and host cells comprising the polynucleotides as well as methods of producing and using the polypeptides and catalytic domains”\n\nThe documents specify that the metagenomic sequence used was isolated from the Logatchev hydrothermal vent:\n\n“The carbonic anhydrase shown as the mat re amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 (which is hereinafter also referred to as ‘Logatchev CA’) was identified as a metagenomic sequence isolated from the Logatchev hydrothermal vent (Perner et al., 2013, Environ. Microbiol. 15: 1551-1560). Use of the metagenomics sequencing technique resulted in the discovery of a new diversity of thermostable carbonic anhydrases not previously found by other methods”\n\nThe intention of the invention is for use to manage and control carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, which is important for a broad range of industrial, agricultural, medical and other technical processes.\nIn particular metagenomic Logatchev carbonic anhydrase may be used for carbon dioxide extraction from CO2 emission streams, e.g., from carbon-based or hydrocarbon-based combustion in electric generation power plants, or from flue gas stacks from such plants, industrial furnaces, stoves, ovens, or fireplaces or from airplane or car exhausts. Metagenomic Logatchev carbonic anhydrases may also be used to remove CO2 in the preparation of industrial gases such as acetylene (C2H2), carbon monoxide (CO), chlorine (Cl2), hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), propane (C3H8), sulfur dioxide (SO2), argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2), and oxygen (O2). Metagenomic Logatchev carbonic anhydrase can also be used to remove CO2 from a raw natural gas during the processing to natural gas.\n\n\n\n\nFermentation\nThis US patent application published in 2004 was submitted by an individual inventor (now attributed to Sederma who were acquired by Croda International) and focuses on methods for producing proteins through the fermentation of microorganisms in the Thermus family (US20040115766A1).24 The abstract describes “The use of fermentation media for microorganisms from the Thermus family, in particular microorganisms collected in marine waters close to very deep hydrothermal sources, especially those obtained with the GY1211 strain. Cosmetic compositions containing one or more types of fermentation media for the microorganisms and which are used, in particular, for skin care…”. The description section describes the background to the organism as follows:\n\n“The process for production of proteins by fermentation of microorganisms according to the present application uses a strain of the genus Thermus, in particular Thermus thermophilus, species GY1211, and have isolated it from a submarine hydrothermal vent (at 2000 meters depth) in the east Pacific ridge in the Guayanas basin (Gulf of California). These are gram negative bacilli, whose size is substantially equal to 0.5 μm×10 μm and which are aerobic, heterotrophic, non-sporulated, thermophilic, barotolerant and which, when cultured, give colonies that are orange, round, regular, smooth, not scalloped.\n\n\n[0017] The strain is registered under the number I-2715 at the National Collection of Micro-organism Cultures of the Pasteur Institute of Paris.\n\n\n[0018] We have discovered that these strains of thermophilic entities are capable of producing or supplying molecules which have numerous physiological activities usable in the cosmetic and dermopharmaceutical fields.”\n\nWhat is clear from this description is that the applicants obtained the strain from a national collection, rather than directly, and in our view this is likely to be the case in many other, if not the majority, of cases.\nThis filing is also of interest as an example of a process patent where the claims focus on the use of an organism in a process as follows:\n\n\n“1. Process for the production of proteins by fermentation of micro-organisms, then extraction of the produced proteins, characterized in that the micro-organisms are of the family Thermus.\n\n\n\nProcess for the production of proteins according to claim 1, characterized in that the micro-organisms are from marine waters located adjacent hydrothermal sources of great depth.\n\n\n\n\nProcess for the production of proteins according to any one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the micro-organisms are of the strain GY1211, deposited under order number I-2715 in the National Culture Collection of Micro-organisms of the Pasteur Institute of Paris.”\n\n\n\nAt issue here is that the patent claims apply to the use of the organism in the production of proteins by fermentation using members of the family Thermus. Claim 2 represents an apparent attempt to preclude the possible use of other members of Thermus from hydrothermal sources at depth. Claim 3 focuses on the specific strain of interest.\nIn this case we are able to identify a family with eight members, including a patent grant in France (FR2821086B1) and 20 citations suggesting a wider impact in this technology space.\n\n\nWhole Genomes\nWe identified two patent families that fall into the category of whole genome patents (O’Malley, Bostanci, and Calvert (2005).\nUS6797466B1 is a patent grant awarded to the J Craig Venter Institute in 2004 with respect to the whole genome of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschi.25 The patent grant links to an original filing in 1996 and was one of the first of a set of filings for whole genomes in the 1990s (the others being Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium as discussed by O’Malley et al 2005). The patent grant in this case discloses that it is based on whole genome sequencing of the organism:\n\n“[00011] M. jannaschii was originally isolated by J. A. Leigh from a sediment sample collected from the sea floor surface at the base of a 2600 m deep “white smoker” chimney located at 21° N on the East Pacific Rise (Jones, W., et al., Arch. Microbiol. 136:254 (1983)). M. jannaschii grows at pressures of up to more than 500 atm and over a temperature range of 48-94° C. with an optimum temperature near 85° C. (Jones, W., et al., Arch. Microbiol. 136:254 (1983)). The organism is autotrophic and a strict anaerobe; and, as the name implies, it produces methane. The dearth of archaeal nucleotide sequence data has hampered attempts to begin constructing a comprehensive comparative evolutionary framework for assessing the molecular basis of the origin and diversification of cellular life.”\n\nA feature of whole genome patents is that they have been judged to lack ‘unity of invention’ in so far that a whole genome has not been considered by examiners to constitute a single invention. These types of filings tend to have a long history of communications between applicants and examiners revealed in the global dossier. In this case this is attested to by an original filing in 1996 that resulted in a grant in more limited form in 2004 for:\n\n“An isolated polynucleotide comprising the nucleic acid sequence of ORF MJ0428, represented by nucleotides 1087456-1088655 of SEQ ID NO:1.”\n\nThis patent grant forms part of a patent family with four members (a single PCT application WO1998007830A2 and its publication with a search report and two patent grants in the United States). The second patent grant US6503729B1 relates to selected polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences from Methanococcus jannaschi. This illustrates the point that applicants for whole genome patents, where they continue to pursue the application, have typically been required to split a filing into separate applications.\nA second example of a whole genome patent application is US20080168572A1. This application from Diversa (subsequently Verenium and later acquired by BASF) relating to the whole genome of an organism and derivative polypeptides as set out in the abstract:26\n\n“The invention provides a genome of the hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans, polypeptides, including enzymes, structural protein and binding proteins, derived from this genome, polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides, methods of making and using these polynucleotides and polypeptides. The invention also provides isolated hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans.”\n\nThe description section describes the origin and the process for obtaining the genome as follows:\n\n“Isolation and Characterization of the Hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans and its Genome [0399] This example describes the isolation and characterization of the hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans of the invention and its genome (SEQ ID NO:1). [0400] To investigate hot submarine vent microbial communities, experiments were carried out to cultivate hyperthermophiles from samples of originally hot rocks and gravel taken at the Kolbeinsey ridge, north of Iceland, see, e.g., Fricke (1989) “Hydrothermal vent communities at the shallow subpolar mid-Atlantic ridge.” Mar. Biol. 102, 425-429. By anaerobic incubation at 90° C. in the presence of S, H2 and CO2, a new autotrophic sulphur-reducing species of the archaeal genus Ignicoccus could be enriched. In contrast to known species, several large spherical Ignicoccus cells were covered by very tiny cocci which could be stained by DNA-specific fluorescence microscopy, using DAPI, see, e.g., Huber (1985) Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 6:105-106. Few such tiny cocci existed in the free state. These tiny cocci could be physically isolated either by using ‘optical tweezers’ (see, e.g., Ashkin (1987) Nature 330:769-771; Huber (1995) Nature 376:57-58; or, or by ultrafiltration, pore width, 0.45 mm. All attempts to grow these organisms in pure culture employing various inorganic and organic energy sources failed. However, isolation of a combination of a tiny coccus attached to an Ignicoccus sphere after incubation under enrichment conditions, resulted in a defined co-culture in which about half of the Ignicoccus cells appeared to be colonized by the tiny cocci. The final density of both the tiny cocci and the Ignicoccus cells was about 3×107 cells ml−1 resulting in about two tiny cocci per Ignicoccus cell on average. The purified co-culture was used in all further investigations. [0401] Cloning of single Ignicoccus cells gave rise to cultures which never contained tiny cocci.”\n\nAs this makes clear the geographic origin of the sample is provided but the actual source of the sample is not. Furthermore, and importantly, this is an example of a method for extracting the genome of the organism now classified as Nanoarchaeum equitans. The claims section of this application focuses on “An isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence having at least 50% sequence identity to SEQ ID…” where the first claim is a list of nucleic acid sequence ids that “wherein the nucleic acid encodes at least one polypeptide having an enzyme, structural or binding activity, and the sequence identities are determined by analysis with a sequence comparison algorithm or by a visual inspection.”\nAn important feature of whole genome patent applications is that they have been treated as lacking ‘unity of invention’ by examiners. That is, patents are granted for a single claimed invention and applications containing whole genome sequences have not been judged to meet this criteria because they may contain multiple inventions. The application of this judgement has quite commonly led to restrictions to patent claims, and in this case it is notable that a significant number of the 181 claims involving 1,073 sequences (such as claims 2 to 7) have been cancelled. No patent grant is observable in the family of five members and the legal status of the US application is given as abandoned due to a failure to respond to an office action since May 2009. This application claims priority to a filing in 2002 at around the time that whole genome patent filings were beginning to emerge more clearly in the patent system at a time of considerable interest in the potential of genomics. This application and the methodology it describes were clearly intended to be more widely applicable. A review of the global dossier (recording correspondence between the patent office and applicants) reveals that the examiners identified 29 possible inventions and were requiring the applicants to restrict the application to one of the inventions if they wished to proceed.27 The applicants did not respond to the request for restriction and the application was automatically determined to be abandoned on the 14th of May 2009 due to the lapse of the time limit for a response.\n\n\nA Sequencing Platform\nSingular Genomics was established in 2016 and is a publicly traded “multiomics” company specialising in next generation sequencing founded by Eli N Glezer.28 The central offer from Singular Genomics is the G4 platform for high throughput sequencing through its G4X platform for spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. In a relatively short time span starting in 2018, Singular Genomics has established a patent portfolio consisting of 124 patent families. These address a range of sequencing related topics and a number of documents make direct reference to organisms collected from underwater places in ABNJ on which we focus here.\nUS11486001B2 is a 2022 patent grant to Singular Genomics Systems Inc for methods and compositions for sequencing complementary polynucleotides. The patent discloses substrates, kits and methods for “preparing and sequencing two or more regions of a double-stranded polynucleotide”.\n\n“[0071] As used herein, the term “thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase” refers to a family of DNA polymerases (e.g., 9° Nm) and mutants thereof derived from the DNA polymerase originally isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaea, Thermococcus sp. 9 degrees N-7, found in hydrothermal vents at that latitude (East Pacific Rise) (Southworth M W, et al. PNAS. 1996; 93(11):5281-5285). A thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase is a member of the family B DNA polymerases. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 3′-5′ exo motif I (Asp-Ile-Glu or DIE) to ALA, AIE, EIE, EID or DIA yielded polymerase with no detectable 3′ exonuclease activity.”\n\nAs such, this is an example of the growing number of patent documents that make reference to the Thermococcus 9N polymerase as an important resource in biotechnology applications. The granted patent claims\n\n” 1. A method of sequencing a polynucleotide comprising a first strand hybridized to a second strand, wherein the first strand and second strand are both attached to a solid support, said method comprising…”\n\nThe granted patent does not make reference to specific named organisms in the claims and is not accompanied by sequence listings. The granted patent forms part of a wider patent family with 13 members targeting (at present) the United States, the European Patent Convention and the Patent Cooperation Treaty.\nA second patent family focuses on spatial sequencing (US20220042084A1) and has led to multiple patent grants in the United States (US11434525B2, US11680288B2, US11753678 B2, US12006534B2). This will normally arise where a single application containing multiple inventions is split into separate filings for a single claimed invention and is revealed by the cancellation of claims 1 to 30 in the original filing. The original filing makes a familiar reference as follows\n\n“[0067] As used herein, the term “thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase” refers to a family of DNA polymerases (e.g., 9° N™) and mutants thereof derived from the DNA polymerase originally isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaea, Thermococcus sp. 9 degrees N-7, found in hydrothermal vents at that latitude (East Pacific Rise) (Southworth M W, et al. PNAS. 1996; 93(11):5281-5285). A thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase is a member of the family B DNA polymerases. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 3′-5′ exo motif I (Asp-Ile-Glu or DIE) to AIA, AIE, EIE, EID or DIA yielded polymerase with no detectable 3′ exonuclease activity.”\n\nAs the first claims in the original filing were cancelled, an illustrative example of the claims from the first granted family member (US11434525B2) is the following:\n\n“1. A method of sequencing a plurality of target RNA molecules of a cell in situ, said method comprising:\n\n\n\nhybridizing an oligonucleotide primer consisting of DNA to each of the plurality of target RNA molecules in a cell, wherein the oligonucleotide primer comprises a first region at a 3′ end that hybridizes to a first complementary region of the RNA molecule, and a second region at a 5′ end that hybridizes to a second complementary region of the RNA molecule, wherein the second complementary region is about 10 to about 150 nucleotides in the 5′ direction with respect to the first complementary region;\n\n\n\n\nextending the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide primer along the RNA molecule to generate a complementary sequence, wherein extending consists of incorporating deoxyribonucleotides into the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide primer, and ligating the complementary sequence to the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide primer thereby forming a circular oligonucleotide consisting of DNA;\n\n\n\n\namplifying the circular oligonucleotide by extending an amplification primer hybridized to the circular oligonucleotide with a strand-displacing polymerase, wherein the amplification primer extension generates an extension product comprising multiple complements of the circular oligonucleotide; and\n\n\n\n\nsequencing the extension product of step (iii) in the cell, wherein sequencing comprises sequencing by synthesis.”\n\n\nIn terms of taxonomic references the claims focus on the genera and certain species of the bacterial cell (rather than polymerases).\nA third family filed in 2019 (US20200080065A1) and granted in 2021 (US1113656B2) focuses on Modified Archaeal Family B Polymerases and specifies that:\n\n“Provided herein are modified Archaeal family B polymerases derived from the Archaeal microorganism Pyrococcus abyssi that exhibit improved incorporation of nucleotide analogues utilized in DNA sequencing.”\n\nWhile the focus of the invention is clearly on a modified Pyrococcus abyssi the document includes the reference to ‘boilerplate’ text on Thermococcus 9N as the example of a thermophilic nucleic acid polymerase”\nThe application claims:\n\n“A polymerase comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical to a continuous 500 amino acid sequence within SEQ ID NO: 1; comprising the following amino acids:\n\n\n\nan alanine, serine, or histidine, at amino acid position 409 or any amino acid that is functionally equivalent to the amino acid position 409;\n\n\n\n\na glycine or alanine at amino acid position 410 or any amino acid that is functionally equivalent to the amino acid position 410; and\n\n\n\n\na proline, valine, or isoleucine at amino acid position 411 or any amino acid that is functionally equivalent to the amino acid position 411.”\n\n\nIn this case we have a clear and explicit patent grant for a modified form of an organism originating in ABNJ.\nThe patent family for modified archaeal family b polymerases contains 9 family members in the US, EP and Patent Cooperation Treaty (WO2020056044A1). While this is a young patent family, it has attracted 11 citations including filings by Illumina and Element Biosciences in what is a competitive technology space.\nA third patent family from Singular Genomics that uses the boilerplate text on Thermococcus focuses on Methods of Synthesizing Labeled Nucleosides (US20190077726A1). The patent application discloses “compounds, compositions, and methods of synthesizing labeled nucleosides” and claims\n\n“1 A method of making a nucleoside having the formula:\n\n\nsaid method comprising mixing a methylthiomethyl donor and a compound having the formula:\n\n\nwherein B is a nucleobase.\n\n\nThe method of claim 1, wherein the methylthiomethyl donor is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)….”\n\nThe application goes on to claim a range of compounds or use in synthesizing nucleotides. At the time of writing the patent family consists of 1 family member and is listed as discontinued in The Lens but is cited in 20 later filings, including patent grants to Singular Genomics for sequencing by synthesis (US11773439B2) and nucleotide analogs (US11958877B2) and modified pyrococcus polymerases (US11034942B1).\nA fourth patent family using the boiler plate Thermococcus text focuses on Methods for In Situ Transcriptomics and Protoemics (US20230100215A1, US11643679B2). The patent grant claims\n\n“A method of detecting at least two nucleic acid molecules in a cell, said method comprising:\n\n\n\ncontacting the cell with a first polynucleotide probe and binding said first polynucleotide probe to a first nucleic acid molecule, and contacting the cell with a second polynucleotide probe and binding said second polynucleotide probe to a second nucleic acid molecule, wherein said first polynucleotide probe comprises a first primer binding sequence and a first barcode sequence, and wherein said second polynucleotide probe comprises a second primer binding sequence and a second barcode sequence;\n\n\n\n\namplifying said first and second polynucleotide probes to generate amplification products;\n\n\n\n\nsequentially sequencing the amplification products comprising the first and second barcode sequences, or the complement thereof, in situ, wherein sequentially sequencing comprises hybridizing a first sequencing primer to a first amplification product or complement thereof, incorporating one or more modified nucleotides into the first sequencing primer with a polymerase to generate a first extension strand, and detecting the one or more incorporated nucleotides in a first optically resolvable feature; and, after generating the first extension strand, hybridizing a second sequencing primer to a second amplification product or complement thereof, incorporating one or more modified nucleotides into the second sequencing primer with a polymerase to generate a second extension strand, and detecting the one or more incorporated nucleotides in a second optically resolvable feature, wherein the first sequencing primer and the second sequencing primer are different sequences;”\n\n\nThis filing is part of a family of 13 members focusing on the US, EP and WO.\nA separate family using the same title as that above and the boilerplate text has also been filed as US20220403457A1 with the claims limited to “A method of monitoring a disease state of a subject…” by obtaining and sequencing and analysing a sample from a subject. The cancelled claims suggest a split into separate claimed inventions and is accompanied by a US grant (US11891656B2)\nAnother patent family using the boilerplate Thermococcus text is PCT filing WO2019164977A1 for Fluorinated Nucleotides and their uses that has also been filed in the US (US20220298201A1). The applicants claim “1. A nucleotide analogue of the formula” and then sets out formulas for analogues and linkers for use in the claimed invention.\nA patent family WO2018165207A1 for Nucleic Acid Sequencing by Synthesis (Sbs) methods combining SBS Cycle Steps also uses the boilerplate Thermococcus text and claims “A method to determine the identity of a nucleotide residue in an extension product…”. The family contains 8 members including two patent grants (US11773439B2, US11591647B2) as well as the PCT filing.\nA separate patent family including US20210189481A1 involves methods for long read sequencing that involves “…alternating series of sequencing cycles and dark extension cycles allowing longer read lengths and addressing disadvantages of traditional nucleic acid sequencing protocols.” The filing also includes the Thermococcus boilerplate text and claims “A method of sequencing a template nucleic acid” using sequencing cycles and extending polynucleotides in dark cycles and then extending the cycle. The focus of the remaining claims are on specific nucleotides and analogues and the use of unspecified polymerase. The patent family consists of 11 members including patent grants in Canada, Australia, and the US (US11225688B2).\nA further patent family involves Linked Paired Strand Sequencing (US20220033895A1) with US granted patent (US11359238B2) which claims “A method of sequencing a double stranded nucleic acid”. The family includes the boilerplate Thermococcus text but the accompanying sequence listings are all characterised as artificial. The patent family contains 15 members that are currently focused only on the US, EP and Patent Cooperation Treaty.\nThe Singular Genomics example presents a more complicated picture of the use of marine genetic resources than we are familiar with because the marine genetic resources form part of a constellation of inventions that combine to form the multiomics platform. In this case the marine genetic resources are repeatedly referenced (by cut and paste by a patent lawyer) and a focus of innovation in individual inventions. The question that this raises for further discussion in the context of the new WIPO treaty is whether it is only those inventions that directly make use of the marine genetic resource that are “based on” the resource or whether some form of benefit-sharing obligation should apply to the wider platform.\n\n\nExopolysaccharides\nThe University of Barcelona filed for a bacterial exopolysaccharide (WO2015117985A1) under the Patent Cooperation Treaty in 2014 as well as submitting for protection in Spain resulting in a patent grant (ES2585398B1).29 The applicant claims:\n\n“1. A strain of Pseudomonas sp. of deposit number CECT8437. 2. An exopolysaccharide isolated from a culture of Pseudomonas sp. of deposit number CECT8437.\n\n\n\nThe exopolysaccharide according to claim 2, comprising glucose, galactose, fucose and uronic acid, in a molar ratio of 2:1 :1 :0.3 approximately.\n\n\n\n\nThe exopolysaccharide according to any of the claims 2-3, comprising the following weight percentages, approximately: 37.29% C, 6.17% H, 2.25% N, and 0.41 % S.”\n\n\nThe document notes that while Pseudomonas is common in polar marine environments, few of them have been classified at the species level from the Polar Regions and no exopolysaccharides have been characterized from these Pseudomonas strains.\nThe abstract is unusual in referring to the species strain and its collection location.\n\n“Pseudomonas sp. CECT8437 is a cold-adapted bacterium isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from Deception Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) that is noted for the highly mucous appearance of its colonies. An exopolysaccharide (EPS) is produced by this strain, which comprises glucose, galactose, fucose and uronic acid in a molar ratio of 2:1:1:0.3 approximately.”\n\nThe claimed uses for the exopolysaccharide are listed in the patent document as follows:\n\n“(i) cryoprotectant agent; (ii) emulsifier agent; (iii) thickening, stabilizing or structural agent; (iv) dermoprotective agent; and (v) agent for increasing skin elasticity. The EPS can be used in cosmetic compositions. Use of the exopolysaccharide as defined in any of the claims 2-5, as cryoprotectant agent.”\n\n\n\nNitrate Removal\nThis is a filing from Solux Lighting Fixture in Korea (US2011262954A1, WO2014010950A1) for a method of removing nitrate from a solution comprising a salt component.30 The abstract to the application states that:\n\n“The present invention provides a method for removing nitrate from a solution comprising a salt component, wherein the method transplants sulfur bacteria to a sulfur-containing plant, and enables the sulfur-containing plant to which the sulfur bacteria is transplanted to contact a solution that comprises a salt component so as to remove nitrate from the solution comprising the salt component.”\n\nThe application refers to many bacteria which may be included in the invention, found on Genbank with a record of collection sites included, including two sequences from a genetic resource originally collected in ABNJ. The invention does not claim any biological or synthesized compounds derived from these genetic resources.\nTepidibacter formici is listed as a sulfur oxidizing bacteria which may be used in the invention:\n\n\n“Tepidibacter formici genes, GenBank accession number JQ670743\n\n\n\n\nThey are sporforming Chemoheterotrophic germs. They may grow in the range of 2 to 6% salt concentration, but the optimal concentration is 3%. The pH range for growth is 5 to 8, and the organic matters (sugar, organic acids) are used as nutrition for growth (related thesis: Urios L, Cueff V, Pignet P, and Barbier G. “Tepidibacter formici genes sp. nov., a novel spore-forming bacterium isolated from a Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal vent”, International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, 2004, 54, pages 439-443)”\n\n\nCaminibacillus sp. is also listed as a potential sulfating bacteria which may be used in the invention:\n\n“Caminibacillus sp. GenBank accession number AB752312\n\n\nAlain K, Pignet P, Zbinden M, Quillevere M, Duchiron F, Donval J P, Lesongeur F, Raguenes G, Crassous P, Querellou J, and Cambon-Bonavita M A. “Caminicella(Caminibacillus) sporogenes gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel thermophilic spore-forming bacterium isolated from an East-Pacific Rise hydrothermal vent”, International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, 2002, 52, pages 1621-1628)”\n\nThe application claims:\n\n“1. A method of removing nitrate from a solution containing a salt element by transplanting sulfur bacteria in a plant containing sulfur and making the sulfur-bacteria-transplanted plant containing sulfur contact the solution containing the salt element.”\n\nClaim 2 sets out a range of plants that can be used for the claimed invention and then specifies a ‘sulfur bacteria’ without specific reference to a particular species or strain and thus intending to include all potential sulfating or sulfate reducing bacteria. The patent family for this application includes 7 members with applications in the United States, under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, China, the European Patent Convention and Japan. A patent grant has been awarded in Korea (KR101342052B1) with the remainder discontinued. No sequences are listed with the family.\n\n\nPlasmids\nA 2011 filing from the University of Regensburg focuses on “…vectors for transforming archaea and to transformed archaea, and in particular to shuttle vector systems for transformation of members of the genus Pyrococcus” (US2011262954A1)31. A reference to hyperthermophilic archaebacterium found in a north Fiji basin hydrothermal vent is mentioned in the references. The summary of the claimed invention provides a good overview of the relationships between organisms and the orientation of research:\n\n“Several reports addressed the initial establishment of genetic techniques for the Thermococcales, a major order of hyperthermophilic euryarchaeota including the genera Thermococcus and Pyrococcus. The first experiments described used the plasmid pGT5 from Pyrococcus abyssi. This plasmid is only 3440 by in size and replicates via a rolling circle mechanism (7). The archaeal plasmid was fused with a pUC 19 vector to create a potential shuttle vector between Escherichia coli and Pyrococcus furiosus (1). This construct could be transformed in both organisms by CaCl2 treatment. Later, this construct was modified by introducing the alcohol dehydrogenase gene from Sulfolobus solfataricus as a selectable marker (3). The resulting plasmids pAG1 and pAG2 were maintained for several generations in E. coli, in the euryarchaeote P. furiosus and also in the crenarchaeote S. acidocaldarius. The presence of these plasmids in the two archaea conferred resistance to butanol and benzyl alcohol.”\n\nThe invention relates to the creation and use of shuttle vectors designed for genetic manipulation in archaea, particularly in the genera Thermococcus and Pyrococcus with a main focus on Pyrococcus abyssi Erauso et al. (1993). A shuttle vector is a plasmid constructed to function in multiple host species.\nThe reference to a place name in an Area Beyond National Jurisdiction is:\n\nErauso, G., F. Charbonnier, T. Barbeyron, P. Forterre, and D. Prieur. 1992. Preliminary characterization of a hyperthermophilic archaebacterium with a plasmid, isolated from a north Fiji basin hydrothermal vent. C. R. Acad., Sci. 314:387-393.\n\nThe applicants claim:\n\n“1. A shuttle vector comprising, in operable association: a bacterial replication origin, a bacterial selection marker gene, a rolling circle replication initiator protein gene, an antibiotic resistance gene that confers selectability in a archaeon, and a regulated archaeal promoter 5′ to a cloning site.”\n\nThe patent application forms part of a small family with three members including a PCT application (WO2011114238A2) and a republication with a search report. While this individual application has not resulted in a large patent family or significant citations it illustrates the overlaps in work on extremophile organisms. Pyrococcus abyssi is widely referenced in patent documents in a total of 2,738 documents belonging to 885 families. A public collection of records is available from The Lens.\n\n\nPhylogenetic Analysis\nA 2010 PCT patent application by the University of California provides for methods for phylogenetic analysis (WO2010151842A2).32 The application “… discloses methods and systems for designing and using organism-specific and/or operational taxon unit (OTU)-specific probes. The methods and systems allow for detecting, identifying and quantitating a plurality of biomolecules or microorganisms in a sample based on the hybridization or binding of target molecules in the sample with the probes. Some embodiments provide methods of selecting an oligonucleotide probe specific for a node on a clustering tree.”\nThe patent document indicates the use of sequences of genetic material originating from ABNJ in the testing and development of the invention.\n\n“Aeromonadaceae DQ816633.1 Zebrafish gut clone EU491914.1 East Pacific Rise”33\n\n\n“Pseudomonadaceae Shewanella frigidimarina EU491790.1 East Pacific Rise seafloor”34\n\nThe application claims:\n\n“1. A system comprising a plurality of probes capable of determining the presence, absence, relative abundance, and/or quantity of at least 10,000 different Operational Taxon Units (OTUs) in a single assay.”\n\nThe patent family for this application consists of thirteen members in the United States, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, Canada, Singapore, Denmark, Japan and the Patent Cooperation Treaty representing a significant investment by the applicant. Patent grants were identified under the European Patent Convention (EP2446062B1) including a grant in Denmark (DK2446062T3) and an additional grant in Japan (JP5795579B2) with the remainder as applications or administrative republications.\nHowever, the PCT filing WO2010151842A2 has also attracted a significant number of citations at 62 including in relation to the detection of hydrocarbons (US9612231B2), detecting genetic variation (EP3243937A1) and claimed inventions for the treatment of a range of disorders. As noted above, citations may be made for a range of reasons and do not necessarily preclude later patent grants. However, later citations reveal the impact of a particular filing or family on the wider technology landscape and can contribute to exploration of the wider landscape.\n\n\nCosmetics (ABNJ reference)\nA 2018 European patent grant to Lucas Meyer Cosmetics Canada Inc. and International Flavors & Fragrances inc. addresses Cosmetic Compositions Comprising Exopolysaccharides Derived From Microbial Mats, and Use Thereof (EP2265249B1) with a key focus on preventing skin ageing and skin conditions. The granted patent discusses EPS from organisms from the deep oceans in\n\n“[0016] Cambon-Bonavita et al., (Journal of Applied Microbiology. Vol. 93, no. 2, August 1, 2002, pp. 310-3015) reports the characterization of an EPS produced by an aerobic, mesophilic and heterotrophic marine bacterium isolated from an East Pacific Rise deep-sea hydrothermal vent polychaete annelid. Rougeaux et al., (Carbohydrate Polymers, Applied Science Publishers, LTD. Barking GB. Vol. 31, no. 4, December 1, 1996, pp. 237-242) and Guezennec et al., (Cabohydrate Polymers, Applied Science Publishers, LTD. Barking GB. Vol. 24, no. 4, January 1994, pp. 287-294) also report the characterization of EPSs produced by different bacterial strains isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Rougeaux et al., and Guezennec et al., discuss that the identified EPSs could be useful in the food industry, in biodetoxification or wastewater treatment, or in the pharmaceutical industry as an anticoagulant comparable to heparin. The biological activities of the identified EPSs were not studied in any of these publications and are thus not reported.”\n\nHowever, in practice the specific focus of the invention is Alteromonas macleodii that are “derived from the fermentation of nine distinct species of bacteria from microbial mats originating from French Polynesia”. The granted patent claims EPS from the fermentation of Alteromonas macleodii and Vibrio alginolyticus. As such, this is an illustration of how the discussion of marine organisms from ABNJ does not necessarily mean that they are the focus of the invention. At the same time, this type of example also suggests the potential range of applications that can arise from the use of marine genetic resources.",

    "text": "An INPADOC patent family consists of a Paris Convention priority document, documents directly linked to that filing and documents judged to be technically related to the filing by examiners. This stands in contrast with DOCDB or ‘simple’ families where only the Paris priority is used. The effect is that counts of first filings are lower using INPADOC families because they ‘see’ relationships that are not visible using ‘simple’ families but the corresponding number of INPADOC family members is also often larger for the same reason. The terms ‘simple’ and ‘extended’ families are sometimes used to describe this but caution is required because different data providers may mean different things when using the same or similar terms.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this section we explore the appearance of marine genetic resources on the internet. The internet is a primary source of public information about marine organisms, compounds and products. However, as of January/February 2023 there are approximately 3.15 billion publicly accessible web pages corresponding with 400 Terabytes of data that are archived by the non-profit Common Crawl. This figure only includes publicly available web pages and does not include those that are in some way protected (e.g. requiring a username and password or not indexed by search engines).\nThe challenge therefore is to identify useful information on marine genetic resources from ABNJ, particularly information relating to commercialisation, in a structured way.\nIn this section we explore different resources and approaches that can assist with enhancing transparency on the utilisation of marine genetic resources in general and marine genetic resources from ABNJ in particular. In doing so, we highlight two recent examples. The first of these is the existence of the Common Crawl as an open access archive of the public internet that is widely used to train Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and many others. Second, we explore the opportunities to automate monitoring of activity involving marine genetic resources at scale represented by combining traditional web research techniques with the AI models to create specialised research agents for specific tasks. We note that the increasing availability of public snapshots of the internet for research purposes presents major opportunities for enhancing transparency on the utilisation of marine genetic resources from ABNJ. However, the challenges involved in interrogating web data at scale, and across multiple languages, mean that these opportunities will be best realised through the assistance of AI models. This in turn will raise questions on how to ensure best practice in:\nWe begin our analysis with a brief introduction to snapshots of the internet, the use of these snapshots in AI and the presence of the marine environment in web snapshot data.",

    "section": "Snapshots of the Web",
    "text": "Snapshots of the Web\nThe emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) to public prominence from late 2022 onwards has led to questions increasingly being asked about the sources of training data that power the creation of these models. This can readily lead to the assumption that individual companies are involved in indexing and scraping the internet when in practice the majority of companies will use the public access Common Crawl.\nCommon Crawl is a US registered non-profit organisation that began collecting public web data from 2008 onwards and made its first release of a public snapshot in 2011 and as a public dataset hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 20121. While the Common Crawl itself is released under a public domain waiver it contains copyrighted material. In the United States use of the Common Crawl can be considered under the protected principle of fair use doctrine while the situation varies in other jurisdictions. Recent legal cases involving copyright and Large Language Models trained on the Common Crawl are likely to clarify the situation in a number of different jurisdictions.\nThe Common Crawl is an example of a widespread practice known as web scraping, exemplified by the work of large companies such as Google in indexing the internet to power search engines and the practices of specialised companies such as market research companies in providing specialist services. Our ability to rapidly find information on the internet would not exist without website indexing and associated scraping of web pages.\nHowever, the scraping of web pages also involves a number of concerns, such as obtaining confidential or personal information (e.g. by accessing specific or protected areas of web sites without permission or harvesting the names of persons from public sites). In response, there are a number of now long standing practices that facilitate the use of web pages in a responsible manner for responsible purposes. The first of these is that activity should be focused exclusively on public pages, rather than seeking to ‘hack’ protected areas of sites. The second is to respect the contents of the ‘robots.txt’ file used by webmasters to indicate the areas of sites that are open for indexing by search engines and those that are closed (expressed through “nofollow” tags). The third factor relates to ensuring that the purpose of the activity is both legal and legitimate. For example, obtaining factual information from web pages constitutes a legitimate and legal use. However, obtaining information on individual persons without their consent would generally not be a legitimate or legal purpose. Finally, many websites contain terms and conditions that should be respected where possible while noting that in the absence of a ‘robots.txt’ it is generally impractical to review terms and conditions for research conducted on a large volume of websites.\nThe Common Crawl expresses these principles in its terms of use. In other circumstances offices for national statistics have developed policies that include the above elements, such as the EU’s current work in progress, WPC ESSnet Webscraping policy draft to guide activities within the European Statistical System (ESS). The authors of the current research adhere to these principles and practices, notably in relation to respecting the ‘robots.txt’, not collecting data outside the scope of the project (such as personal information) and not retaining the raw data.\nWeb scale snapshots from the Common Crawl include the whole panoply of information available on the public internet and will include information that will be racist, offensive or discriminatory. The use of such data to train AI models has been a significant focus of ongoing concern. However, in recognition of these issues, companies within the AI space have also sought to improve the data available for training models by identifying and removing such materials.\nA second factor in the use of internet web snapshots within the AI community is the problem of scale. As noted above the Common Crawl snapshots involve billions of web pages and are hundreds of terabytes in size. This makes its use at scale impractical for many potential users. In response to these issues, in late 2019 a research team at Google released a cleaned up snapshot in the form of the Colossal Crawl C4 dataset. The dataset used a procedure to remove pages containing offensive terms and also sought to remove the vast swathes of duplicate pages and pages consisting purely of code that dominate the Common Crawl snapshots. The Colossal Crawl dataset was used to train the Google T5 series of AI text generation and language translation models (Raffel et al. (2019)). The growing importance of cleaned web scale data to AI as a field has led to increasing efforts to release cleaned up snapshots for wider use.2\nThe growing availability of pre-cleaned web scale snapshot for training Large Language Models also presents opportunities for research teams to access cleaned up datasets for fact based research. We chose to explore the web scale C4 dataset for marine genetic resources as our starting point and as a basis for understanding what the options might be for updating the data in future as new snapshots and new methods become available.",

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nThe C4 dataset is publicly available for download either through the TensorFlow datasets site or through HuggingFace (the main online hub for AI models and datasets) courtesy of work by the Allen Institute for AI and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4. The snapshot is divided by language name and also subdivided by whether the data is clean or raw. To our knowledge, web scale data has not previously been explored for biodiversity and genetic resources and we initially focused our attention on English language web texts in the English clean dataset (“en.clean”).\nThe English clean dataset consists of 364,978,294 million web pages consisting of a url hyperlink for the source page and the text of the page. It is 806 gigabytes in size. The cleaning and deduplication process undertaken by the team at Google radically reduces the size of the data from over 6 terabytes and makes it considerably easier to work with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 66: A View of the C4 open access dataset on the Hugging Face AI hub\nThe identification of marine genetic resources in a dataset of this size can be likened to finding a needle in a haystack. To approach this task our strategy has been to:\n\nBreak the web texts into individual words and phrases removing common stopwords (known as tokenizing);\nIdentify web pages that contain common marine related terms (marine, sea, seas, ocean, oceans and so on);\nUse a dictionary of words and phrases for products (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals etc.) constructed from text mining the International Patent Classification to identify marine web pages that also contain product terms;\nBased on the outcomes to narrow the dataset down to specific areas (e.g. compounds, cosmetics, cosmecueticals, enzymes, krill, pharmaceuticals etc);\nConstruct a ‘fishing net’ dictionary of marine terms (using the work conducted for the scientific and patent data discussed above);\nIdentify product related words in web pages (cosmetic, pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, nutraceutical and so on);\nIdentify marine related terms in the texts containing product terms (co-occurrences) using the marine fishing net. This includes the use of frequency scores for the marine terms to identify highly relevant texts;\nRetrieve the full texts from step 5 where the texts contain both a product and a marine related term;\nUse a machine learning model for named entity recognition on the texts and the identification of products as the basis for further analysis.\n\n\nTokenizing Web Texts\nIn the initial step the 364 million web pages are split into individual words (tokens). Common stop words (e.g. ‘and’, ‘or’ etc.) are removed. Processing is performed in Apache Spark which is widely used for memory efficient large scale parallel processing of texts. Apache Spark can be used with common data science programming languages such as Python using pyspark or R using sparklyr. The code below is written in R with the sparklyr package and assumes that a user already has a Spark cluster running.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sparklyr)\n\nc4_en &lt;- spark_read_json(sc, \"c4_tbl\", path = \"en/*\", memory = FALSE)\n\nspark_unigram &lt;- function(df) {\n  \n  df_tok &lt;- df %&gt;%\n    ft_tokenizer(\n      input_col = \"text\",\n      output_col = \"word\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    ft_stop_words_remover(\n      input_col = \"word\",\n      output_col = \"word_clean\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    mutate(word = explode(word_clean)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(nchar = nchar(word)) %&gt;%\n    select(url, word) %&gt;%\n    mutate(ngram = trim(word))\n}\n\nc4_en_words &lt;- spark_unigram(c4_en)\n\nThis process produced a data table with 69,838,178,742 or ~69.8 billion words and the associated urls for each word. The same exercise was performed to identify two word phrases (bigrams) and produced a table with 77,158,645,013 or ~77 billion phrases. It is possible to expand this approach (for example to three word phrases and so on) but this was deemed sufficient for the immediate purpose.\nOne challenge in approaching 69.8 billion words from 354 million web pages is how to narrow the focus to those pages that involve the marine environment and products, and from there, attempting to isolate marine genetic resources from ABNJ. There are two possible options for this. The first is to identify all web pages in the data that mention some kind of product, accompanied perhaps by words such as “checkout”, “shopping basket” and related terms. This first approach would seek to capture all web pages within the C4 dataset that mention some kind of product and from there narrow the focus down to the marine environment and ABNJ. An alternative approach would be to start by narrowing the data to a set of marine terms and then identify product related terms in the web pages that contain the marine terms.\nWhen dealing with data at the level of billions of items one important challenge is data handling. After a period of experimentation with the first approach we opted for the second approach as it was more practical within the project timeline.",

    "section": "A High Level Overview",
    "text": "A High Level Overview\nWe can begin to explore the data in a straightforward way by seeking to count up the number of pages that contain individual words such as ‘marine’. In total we identified 19.6 million occurrences of the selected marine terms in 9,961,171 distinct web pages. The terms in Table 9 are counts of the number of occurrences of terms in the c4 dataset and have been aggregated (e.g. ‘sea’ and its plural ‘seas’ have been aggregated to the singular ‘sea’).\nTable 9: Occurrences of Marine Terms in Web Pages in English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we might expect, the terms ‘sea’ and ‘ocean’ rank top in terms of occurrences with terms like ‘deep sea’ and ‘hydrothermal’ ranking lower. Note here, that some terms can be expressed either as a single term (e.g., ‘deepsea’ or ‘deep-sea’) or as a two-word phrase (‘deep sea’). We focus here purely on single terms. In other cases, such as ‘hydrothermal’, the term will cover the full spectrum of uses of a term (e.g. ‘hydrothermal energy’ and ‘hydrothermal vents’) rather than being confined to a marine use.\nWe can gain an insight into the uses of these terms in websites by counting up the main or base domains for the sites as set out in Table 10.\nTable 10: Counts of Web Pages for a Selection of Marine Terms for English Websites (top 10 only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we see here is therefore, for websites in English, the full spectrum of sites that address the marine environment of which ABNJ is a part. At the top level we see encyclopaedia sites such as Wikipedia, journals such as PLOS One, a US community marketing site (agreatertown.com), an information site for the US military, trade sites for sales of yachts and boats (www.tradeonlytoday.com), newspapers such as the LA Times (latimes.com) and yachting and nautical map sites (such as geogarage and gpsnauticalcharts.com). In short, analysis of this type, while currently confined to English sites, allows us to gain a sense of the full spectrum of human uses of marine and ABNJ related language.\nThe increasing ability to conduct analysis at this level has important implications for understanding human relationships and perceptions of the marine environment and ABNJ and to evaluate public awareness of international policy measures and their effectiveness. On a wider level, the ability to conduct this type of analysis has implications for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the High Seas Treaty. However, there are two important constraints to conducting analysis at this kind of scale, and across multiple languages. The first of these is computational, in terms of the compute power required. While the issue of compute can be overcome through the allocation of more resources it is here that we encounter a second issue. That is, the ability to extract meaningful information in a timely way to inform policy debates and decision making on topics such as marine genetic resources. It is here, that the increasing opportunities for automation represented by AI could, with appropriate controls and validation, make an important contribution. Data at the level of individual words is useful for gaining a sense of the overall scale of human attention to the marine environment and ABNJ. Breaking texts down into individual words and the ability to assess those words mathematically in the contexts of the company those words keep, to borrow from Raymond Williams, is the foundation for Large Language Models in AI. However, analysis using individual phrases can assist with targeting analysis and navigating the sea of texts on the marine environment produced in human societies. For the present project we now narrow the focus to the exploration of phrases rather than the use of individual words. However, we return to words below, in the context of AI assisted approaches to interrogating web scale data.\n\nProduct Related Terms\nHaving gained an insight into the appearance of marine related terms in the web data the next step is to identify web pages that contain references to products. To do this we use a dictionary of 1,264 product terms derived from text mining the International Patent Classification (IPC). The International Patent Classification is technology focused but also makes extensive reference to a wide range of products (antibiotics, cosmetics, perfumes, nutraceuticals etc.) as part of its organisational logic.\nTable 11 presents the top ranking counts of product related terms by the number of occurrences in the 6,397,346 million distinct web pages containing marine words. That is, approximately 64% of the 9.9 marine related web pages in the C4 dataset also involved a product related term. In total there were 47,972,787 occurrences of product terms.\nTable 11: Counts of Frequency of Product Terms in Marine Pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results, in broad terms, are what we might expect. The product listings include a broad spectrum of products rather than being associated specifically with the marine environment. The prevalence of terms such as ‘food’, ‘oil’ (which may have multiple meanings), ‘fuel’ and so on are to be expected. The high incidence of the terms ‘ship’ and ‘shipping’ is likely to be mainly explained by the appearance of these terms in the terms and conditions of websites in relation to postage of materials with the remainder relating to vessels.\nThe prominence of the words ‘ship’ and ‘shipping’ due to their common use in American English could have a distorting effect in the remaining analysis because it will tend to rank first. We therefore filter the analysis to exclude ‘ship’, ‘ships’ and ‘shipping’. This reduces our raw page count to 6,116,178 from 6,397,346\nTable 12 shows the top domains based on the number of pages containing both marine and product terms.\nTable 12: Counts of Domain Names of Marine Web Pages containing Product Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data has reduced the counts and changed the rankings but demonstrates the ubiquity of product related terms in the marine website data.\nIn an effort to get closer to marine genetic resources we can narrow the focus to specific product categories. Based on earlier research we can select the following:\n\ncompounds\ncosmetics\ncosmeceuticals\ndrugs\nenzymes\nkrill\nnutraceuticals\npharmaceuticals\nsupplements\n\nFiltering to specific product areas and removing duplicates reduces the number of pages to 463,205 from 6,116,178. The top domains are set out in Table 13.\nTable 13: Counts of Marine Page Domain Names containing Filtered Product Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis reduced the domain (website) count to 220,284 from 1.5 million and therefore had a radical impact. However, the data continues to be dominated by sites such as the now defunct urbanhotlist.com, large sites such as Wikipedia, tourism sites, journals such as MDPI as the home of the Marine Drugs journal, a gambling site, major online news sites, google patents and a range of journals and other sites including music sites.\nAn important insight from this exploratory work is that we had originally anticipated that it would be possible to filter the data to commercial .com or .co and similar domain names. However, many of the domains we see in this list, including newspaper and some journal sites are of the .com type making this measure of limited utility.\nIn response to this we turned to text mining and the use of machine learning models to try and extract clearer information on product related activity.\n\n\nA Marine Fishing Net\nThe outcome of the filtering process outlined above was a reduced set of 463,205 pages containing the marine terms and the product terms. In the next step, bearing in mind the noisy nature of this data as seen in the domain names above, we take the texts as is and split them into individual sentences. The aim of this process is a detailed analysis of the occurrence of terms in a ‘marine fishing net’ consisting of 176,496 marine taxonomic, common names and underwater place names that can be used to identify marine genetic resources as summarised in Table 14.\nTable 14: Marine Organisms in OBIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fishing net was constructed in such a way that it can be used to capture individual words and two word phrases and, on that basis to be extended to capture longer phrases (tri-grams etc).\nSplitting the data into sentences resulted in a total of 64,634,994 sentences from the 463,205 texts. In the next step we split each sentence into individual words and phrases. For example, for two word phrases there were just over 1 billion phrases (1,057,079,385). We then matched words (unigrams) and two word phrases (bigrams) against the marine fishing net of taxonomic, common names and place name terms.\nThe objective of this exercise was to identify sentences in the marine products texts that could be linked directly to a marine organism either through a taxonomic name or common name. We decided to focus specifically on the 2,033,247 sentences from 331,525 web pages that contained an ABNJ taxonomic name or a common name listed in OBIS in order to narrow the focus. Table 15 displays the top ranking terms across common names and taxonomic names in the product related pages based on frequency.\nTable 15: Top Terms in Marine Product Pages by Page Count\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see clearly in Table 15 counts by terms will commonly be dominated by single words. As we might expect Table 15 reveals that the word fish is dominant by a considerable margin. This is followed by references to salmon, krill, whales, rays, seaweed, sharks and shrimp, cod and corals (note that terms have not been aggregated in this figure to merge their plural and singular forms which will affect the rankings).\nA more precise view begins to emerge when we focus on the common names of marine organisms involving phrases. Table 16 displays the top ranking common name phrases of approximately 2,527 common names in the data.\nTable 16: Counts of Marine Organisms in Product Pages by Common Name (Phrases)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis begins to reveal some of the more charismatic marine species, notably marine mammals such as sea turtles, whales, polar bears as well as other organisms including algae, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and further down the list, crabs, whale sharks and other sharks, sponges, fish eggs and soft corals among others.\nIn terms of taxonomic names, we identified 1,224 taxonomic names in the ‘ABNJ only’ working dataset in the product category areas. The highest frequency was for krill (Euphausia superba), the Ocean Sunfish (Mola mola), the Norway Lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), the copepod (Calanus finmarchicus) and Crown of Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), the marine bryozoan (Bugula neritina), the Spiny Mudlark (Brissopsis lyrifera), the Boring Sponge (Cliona celata), the Brittle Star (Amphiura filiformis) and Blow lugworm (Arenicola marina), as shown in Table 17.\nTable 17: Counts of Marine Organisms in Product Pages by Taxonomic Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounts of the frequency of occurrence of species in web pages linked to products give us an idea of the intensity of attention to a particular organism. However, when dealing with commercial web activity we also need to be aware of a practice known as ‘keyword stuffing’ or ‘keyword spamming’ where the metadata of a page is crammed with specific keywords in an attempt to secure a higher page ranking in a search engine.3 For the wider marine dataset, this type of practice could explain the high rankings of sites such as the urban hotlist and the appearance of gambling sites. We therefore focus on page counts.\n\n\nABNJ Organisms and Product Pages\nFigure 67 below displays the top ranking organisms from the working set of ‘ABNJ only’ organisms in the web data ranked on the number of pages. In Figure 67 we also observe counts of product pages linked to the organisms, the domains where the product related pages are published and finally the address (url) for the web page itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 67: ABNJ Species and Products in Web Page Texts\nFigure 67 reveals that overall, on taxonomic names, the data is dominated by krill (Euphausia superba). As we might expect, references to products are dominated by the common name krill followed by krill oil. In terms of domains where pages are hosted we can observe the dominance of academic and research sites as well as occasional commercial sites such as aquacave.com and bodykind.com which advertise sales of krill oil. The second ranked organism is the copepod Calanus finmarchicus which appears in connection with products such as Arctic Ruby Oil and fish feed. As this suggests, we are able to begin to explore the details of references to actual or potential products linked to organisms in ABNJ.\nThe Habitats & Features panel in the dashboard presented in static form in Figure 68 allows for the exploration of specific habitats and features recorded in web pages such as for hydrothermal vents. These references are almost entirely from research organisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 68: Counts of Pages Referencing Hydrothermal Vents and Products\nThe dashboard on named underwater places seeks to capture the named locations in texts containing an ABNJ recorded species and references to products and is provided in static form in Figure 69.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 69: Counts of Pages Referencing Hydrothermal Vents and Products\nFigure 69 makes clear that the top named location for species in our working ‘ABNJ only’ list is in fact inside national jurisdiction in the form of the Great Barrier Reef followed by the East Pacific Rise. In terms of domains and web pages the data is dominated by research institutions.",

Note that in many cases the ABNJ associated species name appears in the description section of patent documents and in a smaller number of cases appears in the claims section.\nTable 18: Patent Applicants ABNJ recorded species in claims and filings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 19 presents a summary of the top species appearing in the patent documents.\nTable 19: ABNJ associated species in patent documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now test whether there is evidence of company sales of products arising from these organisms on company websites in the patent data.\nTo do that we adopted a multi step procedure:\nWe used an AI assisted ‘patent company to domain name matcher’ to identify the likely official domain names of the patent applicants. We identified a total of 809 domains from 3,531 patent applicant names.4\n\nWe mapped the domain names of the patent applicants onto the C4 dataset of two word phrases (ngrams). The results consisted of 592,882 individual pages from 809 domains broken down into 307,398,39 two word phrases.\nWe then identified those pages of the websites that contained an ABNJ associated species name that appeared in the patent document.\n\nThis procedure produced a list of 75 web pages for further analysis. Table 20 shows the 25 domains that matched to the ABNJ associated species that appeared in the patent documents.

    "text": "AI Assisted Web Research\nIn the analysis presented above we have presented the first known exploration of a web snapshot for marine biodiversity and commercial products linked to marine biodiversity. The increasing availability of open access web snapshots opens up opportunities to map out the presence of the marine environment on the public internet and to explore topics such as commercial products linked to marine organisms and ABNJ. Because web snapshots are clearly defined and time bound they provide important opportunities for methodological development that can be validated and improved over time.\nA limitation of web snapshots as a data source is that the decisions made by the creators of snapshots may not always be entirely transparent or properly documented and their scale can make them challenging to handle. For the present research the C4 dataset has the limitation of a cut off point somewhere in mid-2019 but has the significant advantage of retaining the url for each page. In contrast, the more recent MADLAD snapshot from the Allen Institute for AI has the advantage of being more recent but does not retain the urls as identifiers thus limiting its utility.\nHowever, looking forward, an important feature of Large Language Models (such as the Google T5 series) is that they are trained on web snapshots such as C4 or segments of such snapshots. As we have seen above, a web snapshot will typically include a wide range of sites including Wikipedia, news websites, journal sites and a host of other public internet sites. The instructions, or ‘prompts’ for these models can be rendered more precise to answer targeted questions and/or they can be ‘fine tuned’ to accurately answer specific types of question (based on known question answer pairs). In short, the emergence of AI tools opens up new opportunities to enhance transparency in relation to the marine environment in general and ABNJ in particular.\nOne of the emerging popular uses of AI models is as research assistants, particularly for web based research. Particular excitement in the AI community surrounds the ability for large (and small) AI models to automate accurate summarisation of texts. However, a key concern is the propensity of large language models to invent information or present incorrect or misleading information in a way that is not obvious to the non-expert reader. The propensity of Large Language Models to get things wrong is known as ‘hallucination’ within the AI community and arises in part from the generative nature of the models (which are trained to creatively generate texts). In other words, a strength of these models is also a weakness.\nConsiderable attention has been dedicated to ways to address this problem. One approach is to literally instruct a model not to make information up. A second is to adjust the ‘temperature’ of a model to reduce its creativity. A third approach is to attach a model to a knowledge base (known as Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG) that serves as the exclusive source of truth for a model when generating answers. A fourth and complementary approach is to instruct a model to always provide the sources for the answers it gives. Combinations of these approaches, which are not mutually exclusive, are proving effective in tasks such as question and answer and summarisation. Ultimately, however, at present in this early stage in the use of AI automation, human review is required for model answers in order to validate AI generated answers.\nA common pattern in research on marine genetic resources is a simple search using Google or a similar search engine. A human researcher then seeks to refine the terms to arrive at a more targeted set of answers and then manually reviews and summarises the results including the sources of the information in the research output. In practice, these common human research activities can be readily automated by creating a so-called ‘research agent’. The creation of research agents as a form of ‘research assistant’ is now becoming popular, a number of companies offer these services, and a range of tutorials are available online.\nThe creation of a research agent to work with the web involves a number of different services and steps. In brief, this involves:\n\nDefining a set of queries (such as taxonomic names or compound names);\nSigning up for services that allow for automated querying and retrieval of data from search engines (for example using Google cloud API services);\nSigning up for an API key to access AI models programmatically (e.g. from OpenAI, Anthropic or a range of other companies) or the more advanced use of a locally hosted AI model;\nA set of instructions (a prompt) for the model to perform when retrieving web results e.g. summarising with a particular aim;\nA separate set of more detailed instructions for the model to perform when analysing the web results (such as extracting taxonomic and common names, summarising information on ecology and geographic distribution, or products that contain components of an organism) and the format for the output;\nWhen working with web data at scale an Application Programming Interface programme (e.g. FastAPI) or similar is required\n\nFinally, at the time of writing, the creation of a research agent requires programming knowledge but paid services such as those from OpenAI allow for the creation of types of research agent. As such, we anticipate that the use of these research agents will become more widespread as AI services expand and mature.\n\nIdentifying Commercial Products\nWe used a research agent as part of an exercise in identifying commercial products linked to species recorded in ABNJ. We chose to use the working set of 7,982 ‘ABNJ only’ taxonomic names for the test and ranked them on the number of occurrences. The working assumption behind this approach was that species recorded in ABNJ at higher frequency are more likely to have been a focus of commercial research and development than low frequency species. Table 21 shows the top ranked organisms.\nTable 21: Working Set of ABNJ Only Organisms ranked by occurrence records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then set the AI research agent the task of iterating over the first 1000 ranked organism names (including genus and above where relevant) to search for and identify whether a commercial product linked to the organism could be identified.\nIt transpires that defining what is, or is not, a commercial product is not as straightforward as it at first appears. At first sight, we can assume that a commercial product is a product that is sold on the market that is based on or contains elements of the organism of interest. However, how is an AI model to know what those elements are? In response to this we included the following draft definition in its instructions.\n\n“You will recognise that commercial products include enzymes, luciferases, biotechnology, chemical compounds, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, medicines, nutraceuticals, supplements, fisheries, foods and other products that are sold for profit”\n\nAs this makes clear, what is understood by a commercial product, could mean quite a number of things that could be articulated in different ways. Success in instructing a model depends on finding formulations that a model can understand when analysing material. For example, the use of the term biotechnology in the above instruction could be considered ambiguous.\nA second issue in instructing a model involves a category that we might characterise as ‘potential’ products. In this category are compounds and other parts of an organism that are a focus of research for potential applications but are not as such marketed products. In an attempt to capture these potential products we included the following instruction.\n\n“If you are asked to search for commercial products you know that some commercial products are potential products such as potential treatments for cancer or diabetes. You should include these even if there is no price.”\n\nIn an attempt to reinforce the importance of potential products we also included a shortened version of this instruction in the initial instruction for scraping and summarisation prior to analysis.\nAn additional objective was to obtain information on the prices of products on the market. Once again, while this could be considered to be straightforward it is in reality ambiguous when seen from the perspective of a Large Language Model. Given the possibility of multiple markets and multiple products, the behaviour of the model was to give an ambiguous answer.\nThe results are summarised in Table 22 focusing on organisms where the web search and summary suggested the existence of some form of actual or potential commercial product.\nTable 22: ABNJ Only Organisms AI Agent Associates with Commercial Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model was asked to write a general summary for all of the species and also to ensure it provided references for all sources. The model was also asked to provide specific details of commercial products in cases where actual or potential commercial products could be identified. The results of this exercise are available in the Annex.\nOf a total of 970 of the top occurring species names in our working dataset, a total of 839 (86%) were not associated with actual or potential commercial products and 129 (13%) of the total were associated with some form of commercial product.\nTable 23 shows an example of a research summary for the Patagonian toothfish.\nTable 23: Example of an ABNJ Only Species Associated with Commercial Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the generation of summaries, the model is also capable of providing details on commercial products. Table 24 shows an example of the details of commercial products for the Patagonian toothfish.\nTable 24: Example of Species Associated with Commercial Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is here however, that the nature of commercial products become relevant. At first sight, the majority of commercial uses referred to the use of an organism in commercial fisheries or in sports fishing rather than uses of a marine genetic resources as such. However, more detailed analysis of the results reveals a more complex picture involving a wider variety of uses.",

    "section": "Product Searches on Amazon",
    "text": "Product Searches on Amazon\nPatent documents give us an insight into the potential commercial uses of a biological organism, along with an indication of intent to commercialise such uses. The scale of patent activity can also be a useful indicator of the scale of commercial interest. However, while patent activity provides a perspective on commercial intent, patent activity only provides a limited insight into the commercial availability of products containing compounds from biological organisms. That is, patent activity cannot tell us definitively what actually makes it to market.\nIn order to bridge this gap, we sought to assess the extent to which we can determine the commercial availability of products containing compounds from marine organisms on the internet. We conducted an experiment using publicly available data from amazon.com, accessed via Rainforest API. An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs specify how software components should interact, enabling the sharing of data and functionalities across various applications. In the context of our work, the use of Rainforest API allowed us to collect results from Amazon web searches at scale, where otherwise searches might have to be completed manually one at a time.\nThe use of the amazon.com domain restricted results only to those which appear to consumers based in the United States and US territories like Puerto Rico. Along with amazon.com, it is possible to access 21 other domains using Rainforest API, from countries including Germany, India and Saudi Arabia. Limiting our experiment to the amazon.com domain was done in the interest of reducing time and cost. The products shown on amazon.com may be available to consumers from other regions, however, this often depends on the shipping choices of individual sellers. As such, the data presented must be seen as a scoping exercise, rather than a comprehensive overview of global market availability.\nAs this data is collected by creating searches on amazon.com, the API does not perform in the way that a traditional API might. Traditional APIs allow users to set clear parameters relating to what they expect to receive in their return, however, since this is not a typical API, it displays some unique characteristics. This can present challenges when attempting an information gathering exercise like the one attempted here, because it may mean that Amazon shows results which may not be directly relevant to the search term used. Many species names are not typical of the types of searches often conducted on Amazon. As a result, these may be considered as spelling mistakes to be corrected. It is possible to turn off spelling mistake correction in calls to the API, however, the issue of ‘fuzzy matching’ appears to be something that cannot be handled through the API. In cases where no direct matches are found for a search query, it may make business sense for Amazon to show users listings which match partially or vaguely on the search term. For example, searches for “eukrohnia hamata” produced results for ham products.\nA further issue encountered was the apparent use of AI to generate product listings, this led to prints, and t-shirts containing images of obscure marine species to appear commonly in the listings. The challenge thus becomes how to filter through irrelevant listings to find listings in which products containing a marine organism may be being sold.\nWithin the current scope of our work, it would not be possible to search for any components or ingredients frequently known to originate from marine species. It is also commonly possible for such components to be obtainable from several different species. For our purposes, we restricted ourselves to attempting to find listings where either the species name or common name were found within the title, keywords, feature bullets and description of each listing.\nWe passed 4,000 marine taxonomic names to the Amazon API. Amazon listings were returned which matched in some way (as defined by Amazon) to our search terms. 31,864 listings were returned. This initial return contained information relating to title and price, information which may be seen on a “results” page when entering a search term. Table 25 below shows a preview of the original return. This initial return did not contain detailed information from the product page itself. In order to get more detailed information about a listing, the ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) must be passed along to the API again, this creates a return which includes the product description and key words, allowing us more insight into the product, its usage and any relevance to marine organisms.\nTable 25: Amazon Original search results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of listings were irrelevant to our purposes. We first removed listings from our original return where stop words were present in the title. Stop words are words that, when present, indicate that it is highly unlikely that the listing is relevant to our present purposes. For example, the presence of words such as “book”, “microphone” or “sofa” in the title of the listing strongly suggest that the product referred to does not contain organic compounds. Table 26 is an example of the type of irrelevant listings that come through. After parsing our listings for stop words, 9,435 listings remained. These listings were returned as results relating to 1,817 of our original 4,000 species, though it was clear that many listings present still were not relevant. After the removal of duplicates, the remaining ASINS were then sent off through the Amazon API. 4,361 listings were returned. These were then joined onto our original listings.\nTable 26: Examples of Junk Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, we had a table with the listing data and the search term (in most cases this was the taxonomic species name, in some cases this was the genus name or the common name). To improve thoroughness, and screen for cases in which a species was referred to in whole or in part by common name, but not by taxonomic name, we joined the table with a list of common names obtained from OBIS.\nIn order to find listings which matched at least one of our names, we filtered the listings to results which contained at least one word from the search term or common name. This likely included many results which still were not relevant. For example, search results for the species Radiella antarctica and Solanometra antarctica included lapel pins in the shape of Antarctica. This did however, allow us to exclude any listings which were categorically irrelevant. This resulted in 1,713 listings.\nDue to the persistence of noise and junk at this level, results were then reduced further to only listings which contained either the full search term, or the full common name. This reduced results further still to 404 listings. Needless to say that from a starting point of 4,000 species names, this was not many. The species for which the most relevant results were found were mostly widely available species, which could be easily be collected from inside or outside EEZ.\nSeveral listings were found for canned tuna species including skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). Sea sponge species were found for sale for homeopathic purposes, including the use of roasted sea sponge for coughs, croup and breathing difficulties. Calcareous sponges were also found for sale for use in homeopathy, for the treatment of sprains, growing pains and acne. The roe of Cheilopogon heterurus, a species of flying fish, was also sold.\nIn the final return, we found 66 listings referring to krill species mostly Euphausia superba. Krill was marketed in the form of krill oil as a source of Omega-3 fatty acids for human consumption, and in some cases directly marketed towards women, with multiple health benefits ascribed to it. Listings also referred to the use of freeze dried krill as fish feed. Table 27 shows the final results for krill species.\nTable 27: Final results for krill species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found 28 listings for products related to sea cucumber species. These listings referred to sea cucumber extract, sea cucumber essence, or whole sea cucumber marketed for wellness benefits. Table 28 shows the final results for sea cucumber species.\nTable 28: Final results for sea cucumber species (sample)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found 14 listings for products related to species from the genus Calanus, a genus of marine copepods. Calanus oil appears most frequently as a source of Omega-3 fatty acids, marketed for human consumption for health benefits. Freeze dried calanus species were also found for sale for use as fish feed. Table 29 shows the results for calanus species.\nTable 29: Final results for calanus species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 70 is a map of Calanus finmarchicus distribution courtesy of GBIF which shows that, while the species is most densely found within ABNJ, it is also found within the EEZ of several countries. This is also the case for many of the other widely distributed species for which results were found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 70: Distribution of calanus finmarchicus from GBIF\nIt does not seem that any species unique to ABNJ are apparent in the listings. If they are available on Amazon, they are not mentioned directly by name. This is not to say that products containing species unique to ABNJ are not available, but rather that they were not found in this search. It is also possible that products containing species unique to ABNJ are not available on Amazon, or that they are not available for sale at all.",

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this section we have explored the appearance of marine genetic resources from ABNJ in hundreds of millions of web pages. To our knowledge this is the first time that this has been attempted. The growing availability of web scale data from the Common Crawl as part of the emergence of Large Language Models in Artificial Intelligence provides important opportunities to identify marine genetic resources at scale. As we have seen, this also offers opportunities to map and explore the multiple ways in which people interact with and value the marine environment.\nAnalysis of web data at this kind of scale is very challenging and AI tools which are trained using web scale data are well suited to supporting analysis of web activity. We engaged in an experiment with creating an online research agent that would access, assess and summarize relevant web pages. This experiment revealed that AI tools can be used to automate searching and summarizing information on marine organisms and can potentially be used for many thousands of species. However, a key limitation of automation using AI is data validation, that is: how do we know that the results returned by an AI model are true? This is an issue that is confronting many AI developers and will find an answer in approaches such as requiring written evidence, cross-validation of results using other models and human review of samples of the results. We should anticipate significant advances in quality control methods in future years. For the BBNJ treaty the use of AI offers opportunities to automate tasks such as researching the use of marine organisms, public awareness of the marine environment and the BBNJ Treaty, and automation of retrieval of information linked to the BBNJ Batch Identifier. In other words, AI promises to improve the ability to automate research and reporting tasks at scale.\nAn important limitation of web scale data and snapshots such as C4 relates to the technologies that are used to generate web pages. Thus, the reason that much of the content of the Common Crawl consists of pages of code rather than text is that many web pages are generated ‘on the fly’ when a visitor arrives at a site rather than existing as static html text. This is significant for research on the commercial use of marine genetic resources because it means that web snapshots such as C4 will be limited to those sites containing static, rather than dynamic, pages. As commercial sites are more likely to use dynamically generated pages the use of snapshots will be biased towards static sites such as news sites and university web pages. Recognition of this issue is an important outcome of the present research in using web scale snapshots. However, the use of automated research agents, which actively visit sites, could assist with overcoming this problem in future (subject to the terms and conditions of the sites visited). As such, it is important to be aware of both the limitations and opportunities for web scale research in the era of AI.\nIn a second independent experiment we explored the use of commercial AI and API services to automate search and summary of Amazon product listings. This experiment revealed that more widely known species such as krill will yield informative results. However, the efforts of commercial sites to always show the customer a results can confound efforts to identify activity for lesser known organisms by flooding the raw results with noise that is very difficult to control. Nevertheless, the promise of this approach is that it may be possible to gain an insight into the emergence of commercial products involving organisms from BBNJ.\nThe results presented in this section should therefore be seen as an initial experiment in exploring the possibilities of web scale research using AI for the automation of searches and reporting to support implementation of the BBNJ Treaty. We anticipate that these types of approaches, with due regard to the limitations and the need for appropriate controls, will become increasingly useful in informing policy decision-making in future years.",
