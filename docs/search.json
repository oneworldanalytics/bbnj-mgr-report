    "text": "Task 1: Mapping marine scientific research on MGR of ABNJ\n\nPublications and funding: Marine Biodiversity – General Overview\nInformation considering 116 million records belonging to marine, brackish, freshwater, or terrestrial environments was compiled. Further analysis revealed that there are 153,810 “marine only” organisms recorded, predominantly at the species level (134,185), with fewer recorded at the genus (14,592) and family (1,902) levels.\nA detailed examination of the ‘marine only’ dataset from the taxonomic perspective highlights the predominance of the kingdom Animalia, particularly emphasizing mollusks and arthropods. Further, some of the most mentioned species in the literature on MGR are: the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the seagrass species Posidonia oceanica and the unicellular alga Dunaliella salina, the edible sea lettuce Ulva lactuca, and Cenarchaeum symbiosum, which has a symbiotic relationship with marine sponges. Viruses are under-represented, with only a couple listed, including the economically significant White Spot Syndrome Virus. Protozoa like Centropyxis aculeata and Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, although less frequent, were also detected as a part of the study.\nExamination of historical trends demonstrates a discernible increase in the number of publications starting from the early 20th century, with a significant surge occurring from around the 1960s onwards. Analysis of the disciplines attached to the highest number of publications presented biology and ecology as the dominating fields, an expected ranking given their direct relevance to marine biodiversity. Applied sciences like fisheries, genetics, and biochemistry follow closely behind. Regarding geographical relevance, the data on publication numbers by UN regions highlights the Americas and Europe as the top contributors, each accounting for approximately 33% of the total publications. Together, these regions constitute nearly two-thirds of the global output, indicating a significant concentration of scholarly activity. Asia follows closely behind with 25% of the total publications, while Oceania and Africa contribute smaller fractions, representing 6% and 3% respectively.\nThe United States, China, and Japan lead in publication counts, indicating significant investment and interest in marine biodiversity research. European countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France also contribute substantially. The French National Centre for Scientific Research stands out at as the top institution, however, is closely followed by The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ocean University of China in the top three rankings, highlighting China’s investment in research. This is further supported by China’s lead in marine research funding followed by the United States, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the European Union, highlighting significant investment in marine research by these countries. Only 11.6% of publications within the marine dataset mention funding information, indicating a low level of transparency in research funding. Funding disclosure in marine biodiversity publications has shown a gradual increase since the early 1990s, peaking in 2016, but displaying some fluctuations thereafter.\nIn relation to the commercial aspect, analysis of the scientific literature shows that there is clear evidence, albeit at a low level, of commercial research on ABNJ organisms in the scientific literature. This is particularly in respect to the genetic and chemical properties of organisms. However, commercially focused research appears to constitute a small part of the wider research effort. In reality, applied research is presently a subset of research activity in ABNJ.\n\n\nPublications: Marine biodiversity from ABNJ\nThe interim working definition of ABNJ demonstrates a difficulty in discriminating with certainty between research conducted in ABNJ and work conducted inside the EEZ. As such, a methodology was developed to incorporate weighted criteria within the scope of the working definition of ABNJ to mediate this challenge. This weighted scoring system serves to assess the likelihood that organisms or features are located within ABNJ. Weighted parameters include underwater features, ocean names, and depth criteria. For example, an organism that is recorded exclusively in ABNJ is assigned a higher probability score than those found in multiple environments. The sum of all of these criteria then allows species to be sorted by level. For the purpose of this summary, priority is given to the higher levels (4 & 6), as those are more likely to incorporate exclusivity for ABNJ.\n\n\nLikely from ABNJ (Level 4)\nIn the present study, 5.5% of the entire marine dataset analyzed is classified as “Level 4.” Among the most researched species at this level are North Atlantic-dwelling copepod Calanus finmarchicus, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, red seabream Pagrus major as a commercially important fish species, the Norwegian lobster Nephrops norvegicus and Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus.While biology and ecology remain the leading disciplines, zoology, geology and oceanography also emerge at the top. The continuous prominence of terms related to fisheries indicates an enduring focus on this area within marine research.\nAlthough country-specific patterns align with the general marine dataset above, as the scope of the dataset is narrowed within this section from the broader marine biodiversity search, China’s prominence decreases. Institutions like the University of Tokyo (Japan), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (USA), University of Bergen (Norway), and University of Washington (USA) rise in rankings, indicating a shift in research prominence (Fig. 1). Additionally, the United Nations regions’ analysis shows Europe surpassing the USA, as research focus narrows to ABNJ, evidenced by a higher publication share.\n\n\nVery Likely from ABNJ (Level 6)\nLevel 6, which accounts for a mere 0.3% of the overall marine dataset analyzed indicating low-level research activity as the likelihood of exclusivity to ABNJ increases. Within this level, taxonomic focus narrows to specific species, including Antarctic krill, blind shrimp like Rimicarisexoculata, the mollusc Bathymodiolus azoricus, and the polychaete worm Alvinella pompejana. Other notable organisms include the abyssal grenadier fish Coryphaenoides armatus and the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Research publications peaked in 2008 with 61 articles, with a notable increase in mentions of concepts related to hydrothermal circulation and vent systems. France has further secured its position as a significant contributor, with institutions like IFREMER and the French National Centre for Scientific Research leading in publication output (Fig. 1). The US maintains a strong presence, while Europe’s share of activity is on the rise (Fig. 2). Overall, Level 6 marks a transition to more specialized research, with distinct patterns in publication activity and research focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Publication Activity by Affiliation at Increasingly Narrow Scope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Regional Share of Publications at Increasingly Narrow Scope\n\n\nGeographical distribution\nOne of the weighted criteria applied focused on geographical distribution, as our study mapped ABNJ MGR research both vertically (depth) and horizontally (features). This distribution links research data to ABNJ-specific locations and named underwater locations, such as seamounts and hydrothermal vents. The analysis reveals 7,204 publications for marine organisms involving 607 underwater places either in the EEZ or ABNJ. Of these, 89 underwater places were identified as ABNJ-alone involving 2,491 publications.\n\n\nCollaboration networks\nMarine scientific research often encompasses collaboration among researchers from various organizations and countries, and mapping these collaborations helps visualize the dominant actors within the marine research landscape. The present work presents three types of interactive collaboration networks, focusing on: 1) Institutions, 2) Countries, and 3) Funding. Notable observations highlight that collaborations between Low-Income and High-Income countries are prevalent, whereas partnerships among Low-Income countries are rare (see for instance Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of a network analysis of collaborations (with Madagascar)",

    "text": "Task 2: Analyzing the market value and commercialization potential of MGR of ABNJ through scientific and patent assessments\n\nPatent landscape and market\nThe analysis encompassing organisms tagged as “marine” in Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) identified 4,903 organisms within patent data, linked to 53,768 first patent filings from 1990 to 2021, revealing an increasing trend (Fig. 4). One notable influencing aspect of the patent landscape analysis is the geographic distribution of patent activities, with a strong presence in developed countries (the US remains at the very top, followed by the European Patent Office) and emerging contributions from nations like China.\nThe primary areas of patent activity include biotechnology and genetic engineering, peptides, genetically engineered plants, fermentation, measuring and testing processes, biocides, foods, and cosmetics. Major applicants include large agricultural companies such as Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Monsanto, BASF, and Bayer Cropscience, enzyme producers like Novozymes (now Novensis), and universities such as the University of California. Geographically, the majority of filings occurred in the United States, followed by the European Patent Office, Japan, and other developed countries. Over 50% of filings in major markets such as the United States originated from non-residents, indicating a global interest in seeking patent protection in these regions.\nA focused filter on marine-only organisms showed 534 filings in 2017, with a potential decline afterwards, suggesting shifts in country rankings and applicants (Fig. 4). When analyzing species recorded in ABNJ in OBIS that can be found in other locations as well, the activity was found to be less than 500 filings per year and concentrated in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. This narrowed scope fostered a significant change in applicant rankings, exemplified by Novozymes experiencing a sharp decline in their position based on initial filings. Conversely, Bayer Cropscience ascended to the top ranking, followed by Syngenta Participations in second place, while the University of California consistently maintained its third position, unaffected by the filtering criteria.\nA third and narrower filter, analyzing patents involving marine organisms that may exist only in ABNJ showed that patent filing activity was typically under 150 filings per year (Fig. 4). Interestingly, narrowed focus again resulted in a shift concerning applicant rankings, with different subsidiaries of BayerAG taking over the top. Pioner Hi-Bred International is also present among the top 5, whilst University of California ranking sinks down to the 5th position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. First Filing of Patent Families with Narrowing Scope\nWith respect to the patent analysis, there are growing references to marine organisms in patent data, as well as to organisms recorded in ABNJ. In a small number of cases, notably Calanus finmarchius as well as the enzymes from Thermococcus 9N, there is evidence of the intent to commercialize explicitly from ABNJ. However, the outputs of this search reiterate the concept that the existence of a patent family does not equate to the existence of a product on the market. Overall, definitive evidence for the collection of organisms from ABNJ that later appear in patent documents remains low in the overall landscape.",

    "text": "Task 3: Proposing regulatory frameworks for the equitable distribution of monetary benefits derived from MGR of ABNJ utilization\n\nIdentification of MGR based products that could have come from ABNJ\nIn Tasks 1 and 2, extensive big data analyses were conducted to understand the current state of play regarding the valorisation of MGR of ABNJ. This involved examining scientific research activities and intellectual property developments related to these resources, resulting in insights into the commercial potential and existing patent landscape. The primary aim of Task 3 was to explore and evaluate different regulatory options for monetary benefit-sharing mechanisms associated with MGR of ABNJ, addressing a key aspect of the BBNJ treaty negotiations, and use the input from tasks 1 and 2 to assess the current state of actual valorisation of MGR of ABNJ.\nSeveral methods were applied to identify if there are currently any products on the market that are derived from MGR of ABNJ: the literature search and patent search from tasks 1&2, a novel method using an AI tool to search a copy of the entire internet (the ‘common crawl’) and manual confirmation of all possible leads. This exercise turned out to be very complex, due to several challenges. First of all, in most cases of historic R&D it is not possible to say with certainty if the target organism was indeed coming from ABNJ or not, as there is no information of the location of the first sample used for the R&D. Therefore, all results, apart from one, in this study should be interpreted as could have come from ABNJ: as a matter of transparency all the products based on MGR that could have originated from ABNJ have been included in the study, even when the likelihood is low according to the available data, and this is specified where possible. A global search also comes with language challenges, which results in a bias in the results towards products that have associated publications in English. When searching for product revenue, companies have no legal obligation to disclose this information. It is therefore impossible to make an accurate assessment of how much the current MGR products on the market generate in yearly revenue, so rough estimations are used.1\nIt is argued that the introduction of the BBNJ Batch Identifier will play a key role in future assessment of MGR of ABNJ valorisation. The Batch Identifier, in combination with the new WIPO disclosure of origin requirement2 for patent applications, should guarantee that any future product developed from an MGR of ABNJ will be properly documented and reported.\nThe search for potential MGR products on the market identified nine organisms linked to 74 products that are developed based on MGR that could have come from ABNJ. The total combined estimated revenue of these products is between $400 and $650 million per year, though it is for now impossible to assess with any certainty whether this revenue can be attributed to ABNJ or not. Out of those 74 products, only 1, can be attributed to an MGR of ABNJ with 100% certainty (i.e. the R&D was conducted on an organism collected from a known location in ABNJ and the MGR is fundamental to the product). To the best of our knowledge, none of these products were the result of the use of digital sequence information (DSI) only.\n\n\nRegulatory frameworks for benefit-sharing: analysis and monetary benefit-sharing estimations\nTask 3 presents a comprehensive analysis of regulatory options for monetary benefit-sharing associated with MGR of ABNJ. Building upon previous tasks that analysed the current state of MGR valorisation, this task delves into the complex issue of ensuring fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from MGR. The study identifies and evaluates different monetary benefit-sharing mechanisms, aiming to provide substantive support for future negotiations at the BBNJ Conference of the Parties (COP).\nThe analysis identified several potential monetary benefit-sharing modalities, which were divided into coupled and decoupled options. Coupled options, where benefits are directly linked to the financial success of commercialized products, include royalties on sales, milestone payments, profit sharing, and licensing fees. Decoupled options, where benefits are not directly tied to the success of utilization, include fixed access fees, annual licensing fees, flat contribution mechanisms, subscription models, membership fees, and a micro-levy on proxy parameters like equipment or vessel usage.\nUsing a decision matrix based on different sets of criteria, a decision was made to focus further work on milestone payments, revenue-based payments, a decoupled fee-based system, and a potential micro-levy. The first two options are explicitly listed in Article 14.7 of the BBNJ treaty, while decoupled options were selected based on their feasibility and potential for broad applicability and sustainability. The integration of a tiered fee structure was also considered to tailor financial contributions to reflect varying capacities and impacts of different users, ensuring a fair and balanced system.\nThe analysis of coupled payment options for monetary benefit-sharing of MGR of ABNJ revealed both potential revenue and significant challenges. Revenue-based payments and milestone payments were identified as possible mechanisms; however, their effectiveness is contingent on the commercial success of MGR-derived products. Applying a 1% revenue-based payment to the estimated market value of $400 million could generate approximately $4 million annually, and up to $6.5 million at the higher market value estimate of $650 million per year. It is important to note that this revenue (1) is linked to products using MGR that could have come from ABNJ and (2) are the result of past utilization, and therefore potentially outside the scope3 of the BBNJ Treaty.\nDespite their potential, these coupled payment mechanisms pose challenges, including the need for robust tracking and administrative systems to monitor financial flows and ensure compliance. This requirement could impose substantial burdens on users and regulators, complicating implementation and management. Additionally, the variable nature of commercial success in the biotechnology sector could result in unpredictable revenue streams, potentially undermining the stability and reliability of the benefit-sharing fund. We also highlighted that milestone payments would only realistically be possible for pharmaceutical products and would come with significant downsides. Finally, the current international and national financial reporting obligations do not offer the tools to identify revenue at product level.\nThe evaluation of decoupled payment options for monetary benefit-sharing highlighted the flexibility and predictability these mechanisms offer. Fixed annual fees, for instance in the shape of an annual licensing fee or membership fee, could distribute the financial burden across a broader user base. For example, using publication and patent data as proxies to identify who has research and commercial interests in MGR of ABNJ respectively, a decoupled fee system could generate between $4 and $6 million USD per year. We did not find a suitable way to implement a micro-levy.\nDecoupled mechanisms also present challenges. While they could provide a steady revenue stream, they may not fully capture the value from high-profit activities, potentially leading to fairness issues. Furthermore, these mechanisms require careful calibration to ensure they are equitable and do not disproportionately impact certain users and thus hamper R&D. The predictability and broader participation of decoupled payments make them attractive, but their implementation must be carefully designed to balance equity and effectiveness. The BBNJ batch identifier could help with more reliably determining the non-commercial and commercial actors active in the MGR of ABNJ space",

    "text": "The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) initiated discussions on an international legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in ABNJ in 2017, leading to the launch of intergovernmental negotiations in 2018. These negotiations culminated in the approval of the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) treaty in 2023, which addresses a package of elements, including marine genetic resources (MGR) with a focus on benefit-sharing, area-based management tools, environmental impact assessments, and capacity building and technology transfer. Among these, the issue of MGR in ABNJ has generated significant interest and debate. Despite this, the commercial value of these resources remains uncertain. Between 2006 and 2013, the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group on marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction repeatedly highlighted the need for more research to assess the economic value of MGR in ABNJ to inform decision-making. However, to date, only one comprehensive study has been conducted — in 2014.\nThe main objective of this study is to provide evidence-based information and analysis on the actual and potential market value of marine genetic resources (MGR) from areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). This aims to support the implementation of the legally binding BBNJ agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. Building upon previous investigations, this study focused on three specific objectives: 1) mapping recent and planned marine scientific research activities exploring MGR in ABNJ, 2) analyzing the market value and commercialization of MGR from ABNJ through a scientific and patent landscape analysis, and 3) proposing regulatory options for the sharing of monetary benefits derived from the utilization of MGR in ABNJ.\nThis lack of extensive assessment on the commercial value and market scale of MGR in ABNJ has led to divergent narratives about its potential. Developing countries advocated for monetary benefit-sharing mechanisms, while developed countries expressed concerns about the costs associated with monitoring and implementing such systems. Understanding the actual and potential market value and commercialization of MGR in ABNJ is therefore crucial to shaping and implementing an efficient and equitable benefit-sharing framework.\nThis project was conducted by a consortium led by ABS International, with the support of One World Analytics and the University of Aberdeen. The methodology employed builds on the earlier work conducted in 2014, which was carried out by the One World Analytics team.",

    "section": "Research on Marine Biodiversity",
    "text": "Research on Marine Biodiversity\nFor the purposes of this research, we assume that published research on marine biodiversity typically references organisms using either taxonomic names or common (vernacular) names. The Biodiversity Graph is a citation graph of the scientific literature. Thus, it is well-suited to offer an overview of research on marine biodiversity. It is built upon publications that reference taxonomic names and the ensuing citation networks derived from those publications.\nA key issue highlighted in the 2014 report ‘Valuing the Deep’and subsequent research is the challenge of identifying which organisms occur solely in marine environments, which are found in both marine and other environments, and which organisms are not marine at all. Recent innovations at OBIS,1 based on contributions from the WoRMS database,2 introduce fields identifying whether an organism among the 116 million records is found in marine, brackish, freshwater, or terrestrial environments. Table 1 provides a summary of this data. Using these indicators, we can estimate the number of organisms by rank that, according to OBIS data, are exclusively observed in the marine environment or are ‘marine only’ as they will be described below. As we will see, while this categorisation is far from perfect, it is useful for the purposes of the present study.\nTable 1: Marine Organisms in OBIS by Taxonomic Rank and Habitat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to emphasise that classifying an organism as “marine only” based on the available data in OBIS does not necessarily mean that the organism is exclusively found in marine environments. Instead, this calculated measure aids in excluding a significant number of organisms known to inhabit non-marine environments, thus refining the scope of the analysis. Furthermore, higher-order taxonomic ranks—such as phyla, families, and genera—are more likely to encompass organisms found in multiple environments. As a result, we cite these for illustration but centre our analysis on the species level. For our purposes, the species level refers solely to a binomial taxonomic name. It does not incorporate details like the taxonomic authority. This is largely because many works outside the taxonomic community use binomials and often omit details such as the taxonomic authority (the name of the individual or individuals who first validly published the name). Those familiar with the NCBI taxonomy may encounter some variation from their expectations as while it is widely used, it lacks taxonomic authority.\nThe Biodiversity Graph represents a relatively new method of recording biodiversity records, though citation graphs are well established in the scientometric and bibliometric literature. Within the biodiversity community, the citation graph-based approach is gaining in popularity, with taxonomists aiming to highlight the contributions of taxonomic specialists to the broader biodiversity-related scientific record.\nGiven the novelty of our citation graph, we decided to validate the 21 million records in the current graph against an independently constructed dataset for marine biodiversity. This was done using the original keyword-based Valuing the Deep dataset, which contains 17,434 DOIs, a 2014 reference set of 21,548 DOIs from the MarinLit database of marine natural product-related literature, and a dataset of 6,659 DOIs from the 2019 WIPO landscape study on marine genetic resources in South-East Asian (ASEAN) countries (Oldham, Shale, and Kindness (2019). Since these sets are now out of date, we retrieved the references and subsequent citing publications to build a dataset of 1,240,324 documents linked to the original sets. The metadata for these 1.2 million documents was obtained using the Lens Scholarly API, processed using the Humboldt NER model, and combined with the OBIS dataset of ‘marine only’ taxonomic names to create a marine reference graph,3 In total, this graph included 30,955 ‘marine only’ taxonomic names (all ranks) in 161,698 publications and 23,095 binomial species names in 113,050 publications.\nConversely, the Biodiversity Graph comprised 49,695 ‘marine only’ taxonomic names in 452,248 publications and 39,362 binomial names in 308,766 publications.4 The distinction between the marine reference graph and the Biodiversity Graph lies in their construction methods: the former was mainly assembled using searches for various marine-related terms (e.g., mud volcanoes in the Valuing the Deep study) and therefore mirrors the limitations of the initial parameters. The Biodiversity Graph, on the other hand, was designed to capture information on organisms by text mining published research literature for millions of taxonomic names and all their citations. Thus, as expected, the Biodiversity Graph would demonstrate broader coverage.\nAs these figures indicate, a substantial gap exists between the appearance of names in the taxonomic record and their presence in scientific publications available to researchers in digital datasets like OpenAlex. With the increasing digitization of taxonomic records, especially through initiatives such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library, we anticipate that coverage will continually improve.5 Enhancements in access to the full texts of scientific publications should further boost the capture of taxonomic names and their associated common or vernacular names. However, as detailed further below, our capability to spotlight research on biodiversity or any other subject is limited by the availability of digital data and our access to it.\nThe decision to focus on ‘marine only’ species recorded in the existing OBIS data has certain collateral effects. One such effect is the omission of commercially significant species, such as the giant tiger prawn Penaeus monodon, a central focus of aquaculture in South-East Asia and beyond, from our dataset (Oldham, Shale, and Kindness (2019). While this exclusion narrows our dataset, it allows us to focus our analysis on organisms found solely in marine environments, with the aim of mapping the landscape of research and innovation involving marine genetic resources specifically from the High Seas.\nWith these caveats and observations in mind, we present a general summary of global research on marine biodiversity. As a starting point Figure 5 provides a general overview of the most common terms in the data, including taxonomic, common, habitat and place names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A summary of the number of publications and rankings of terms across labels for Taxonomic, Common, Habitat and Place Names.\nThe rankings in Figure 5 are generated by processing publication data with our Humboldt NER model to extract terms. This model is trained to recognise entities within taxonomic categories, which for our purposes included Species, Uninomials (including the genus, family, or higher order name), Common Names and Viruses, as well as place names and habitats. The training data for the habitat label was derived from a combination of a review of the European Environment Agency’s EUNIS habitat classification (2019 revision) and the real-world use of habitat-related terminology in texts. As an approach, term capture by deep-learning-based Named Entity Recognition models is superior to dictionary-based approaches, as these may fail to capture term variations, such as plurals and minor spelling variations, as observed in the raw data for Figure 5. However, models such as Humboldt NER are not perfect, and for our purposes a more specialised approach to certain labels, particularly place names, is required to identify entities which may not have been picked up by the model. It is also worth noting that data capture is confined to the available metadata for publications (e.g., titles, abstracts, author keywords, concept information, etc.) as opposed to the text of these publications themselves.\nWe will now explore our ‘marine only’ dataset in more detail. Figure 6 provides an overview of the top taxonomic entities deemed to be ‘marine only’. In approaching Figure 6, note that terms that are marked as ‘Not Known’ refer to taxonomic names that did not match to the GBIF taxonomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: A summary of the number of publications and rankings for marine only organisms, ranging from Kingdom to Phylum, Species and Uninomial Names.\nFigure 6 reveals, as we might expect, that the top rankings are for animals (Animalia). The data is dominated by molluscs (Mollusca) and arthropods (Arthropoda) such as crabs. The limitations of attempts to restrict results to organisms from specific environments are apparent when we consider the prominence of bacteria, notably members of Vibrio including Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of Cholera, which is not confined to marine environments. Other bacteria such as Shewanella putrefaciens are associated with iron and manganese reduction. Marine chromists are represented by diatoms such as Phaeodactylum tricornutum, for which reported uses have been found in biotechnology. A significant number of publications involve species with an unidentified Kingdom, arising from gaps in the GBIF taxonomy. An example would be the edible marine fungus Ecklonia cava. Among plants (Plantae) we observe a significant number of publications on the seagrass Posidonia oceanica and Dunaliella salina, a unicellular algae found in saline environments that is also sold as a supplement, while Ulval lactuca is an edible sea lettuce. For fungi we observe Trichoderma harzianum which appears to occur across multiple environments as does the halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii. Archaea are represented at low frequency by Thermoplasma acidophilum which again has been isolated in multiple environments and Cenarchaeum symbiosum which forms a symbiotic relationship with marine sponges. Viruses will be under-represented in this data because only two viruses are currently listed across OBIS, these include the commercially significant White Spot Syndrome Virus which has wide ranging impacts in aquaculture worldwide, notably in South-East Asian shrimp farms. Protozoa are represented at low frequency by Centropyxis aculeata and Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis.\nAs this brief discussion suggests, in practice while the focus has been significantly narrowed towards species only found in marine environments, we will still encounter species that occur in both marine and non-marine environments. Furthermore, these organisms may occur inside and outside the High Seas. Bearing in mind these considerations, challenges and caveats, we now direct our attention more specifically to the prevailing trends, central topics, and key players and main actors observed within the data.\n\nTrends, Topics and Actors\nFigure 7 provides an overview of trends, topics and country counts by number of publications and research institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Trends, Major Topics and Actors in the Marine Biodiversity Scientific Landscape\nIn examining Figure 7 it is apparent that the history of publication of research related to marine biodiversity extends to at least the early 20th Century. The analysis of trends in publications is affected by the availability of titles and abstracts in databases arising from copyright restrictions. Thus, the obvious dip in the data on trends reflects a gap in open access to abstract data.6 The ‘Concepts’ field pertains to article labels applied to publications in OpenAlex using the hierarchical open access Wikidata taxonomy. Predictably, the primary fields of study are biology and ecology. These are followed by applied topics such as fishery, genetics and biochemistry. When considering major topics such as Geology, note that the criteria for inclusion in this marine biodiversity graph is that the publications must be related to marine organisms in some way. As such the data will not capture all geological research or, as we see further down in the ‘Concepts’ panel of Figure 7, all publications in overarching disciplines such as Oceanography.\nCountry rankings and affiliation data are inherently incomplete. This is because this information may not be captured in the metadata of scientific publications, or it may not be recorded in the first place. This inherent limitation may skew our perception of research activity, as we are working with a dataset that, by its nature, is and will remain incomplete. Since data access has improved recently, newer data is more likely to be complete. Nevertheless, overall rankings will be affected by the lack of availability of affiliation data. When interpreting affiliation rankings, the presence of aggregate organisations should also be noted, such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Such organisations may be comprised of institutions which commonly act separately from one another. Conversely, some entities, while listed individually, might be part of broader institutions, resulting in comparisons that aren’t directly analogous. Furthermore, variations in entity naming add another layer of complexity. For instance, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration might be denoted as NOAA or other name variants, resulting in treatment as separate entities in the rankings.\nAs a result, these statistics, while informative, should not be considered definitive. Absent or incomplete affiliation data, coupled with the difficulty of handling variations of the same name (often referred to as the ‘names game’) is a significant concern for institutions and, in particular, for research funding organisations in evaluating the outcomes of their investments. To address these challenges, initiatives such as the open Research Organizations Registry (ROR) aim to provide harmonised data on organisations and funding bodies. Important initiatives such as ROR increasingly allow us to map global research activity as illustrated in Figure 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: This figure uses Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifiers with affiliation data to render a global map of activity. The map will not cover all institutions and may contain inaccurate coordinates\nFigure 8 demonstrates that the publication of research on marine biodiversity is now widely distributed around the world with discernible hot-spots of activity in all major world regions, with hubs of activity present in the United States, Western Europe and East Asia.\nMarine scientific research frequently involves networks of collaboration between researchers based in different organisations and different countries. The promotion of international partnerships and collaboration is a common priority for research organisations. Mapping these collaborations allows us to visualise networks of dominant actors within marine research, as shown in Figure 9.\n\nnew_inst = await FileAttachment(\"data/inst_network_june.json\").json();\n\ninst_code = function() {\n    var [option,myChart]=this.getVars()\n    var option;\n\n    myChart.showLoading();\n\n    var graph = new_inst;\n    \n     if (!graph || !graph.nodes || !graph.links || !graph.categories) {\n        console.error(\"Graph data is missing or malformed\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    myChart.hideLoading();\n\n    graph.nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n        node.label = {\n            show: node.symbolSize &gt; 16\n        };\n    });\n\n    option = {\n        tooltip: {},\n        legend: {\n    selectedMode: false,//'multiple',\n    // hoverLink: false,\n    data: graph.categories.filter(function(a) {\n        return [\"AU\", \"CN\", \"FR\", \"Japan\", \"GB\", \"US\"  ].includes(a.name);\n    }).map(function(a) {\n        return a.name;\n    }),\n    left: 'left'\n},\n        animation: false,\n        series: [{\n            name: 'Institution',\n            type: 'graph',\n            layout: 'force',\n            data: graph.nodes,\n            links: graph.links,\n            categories: graph.categories,\n            roam: true,\n            scaleLimit: {\n            min: 0.8, // minimum zoom level (0.5 means the chart can be zoomed out to half its original size)\n            max: 3   // maximum zoom level (2 means the chart can be zoomed in to twice its original size)\n            },\n            zoom: 1,\n            label: {\n                position: 'right',\n                formatter: '{b}',\n                opacity: 1,\n                backgroundColor: '#fff', \n                borderColor: '#fff',  // Add border to labels\n                borderWidth: 3  // Set border width\n                    //          rich: {\n                //    a: {\n                 //       backgroundColor: '#fff',\n                ////        borderColor: '#fff',\n                 //       borderWidth: 0.9,\n                   //     borderRadius: 5,  // Set border radius for rounded corners\n                     //   padding: [2, 4]  // Add padding to labels\n                //    }\n                //}\n            },\n            labelLayout: {\n            hideOverlap: true\n            },\n            lineStyle: {\n                color: 'source',\n                curveness: 0.3, \n                opacity: 0.1\n            },\n            force: {\n              repulsion: [600, 1200],\n              edgeLength: [200, 600]\n            },\n            emphasis: {\n                focus: 'adjacency',\n                lineStyle: {\n                    width: 10\n                },\n                 itemStyle: {\n        opacity: 1\n                 },\n            }\n        }]\n    };\n\n    option && myChart.setOption(option);\n\n}\n\nnew EchartsRunner()\n  .addCodes(inst_code)\n  .show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The academic collaboration network of institutions publishing research on marine biodiversity\nThis snapshot displays institutions that have published 1,000 or more scientific papers relating to marine biodiversity. Nodes are sized based on the number of publications produced by each institution and edges (lines) between nodes indicate that authors from these institutions have collaborated on a publication containing reference to a marine species. The numbers in the visuals reflect the total number of publications on marine biodiversity research output by each institution.\nFigure 10 shows the collaboration network for the French National Centre for Scientific Research, the most prolific author in the dataset, with 45,128 instances of collaboration with other institutions and 9,472 papers published on marine biodiversity. Figure 11 illustrates the same for the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with 21,394 instances of collaboration with authors from other institutions and 6,545 total publications found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The academic collaboration network for the French National Centre for Scientific Research.\nThese networks of relations between researchers reflect underlying investments by countries into collaboration and the development of marine research capacity. Whether it is possible to identify levels of investment into research remains a topic of future research. However, it is possible to gain an insight into some of the key agencies involved in supporting deep-sea related research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: The academic collaboration network of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nTable 2 shows the top institutions ranked by number of publications on marine biodiversity, alongside the total collaborations, instances where authors from each institution have collaborated with authors from another institution.\nTable 2: Table of total publications by institution (top ranked for illustration)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries and Regions\nThe data presented above can be broken down by number of publications per country and by United Nations Statistical Division region and sub-region as set out in Figure 12. In the data we have, while the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are the most prolific publishing institutions, as seen in figures above, the United States is the largest publisher of marine research overall, indicating that publication on marine biodiversity in the United States is more dispersed amongst different institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Country rankings by number of publications for UN major regions and UN sub-regions\nAuthors often collaborate with authors in different institutions across the globe. It is possible to examine this international collaboration to create a picture of global marine biodiversity research relationships. Figure 13 spotlights this international collaboration, depicting the frequency with which authors from institutions in different countries collaborate on marine research publications. Only countries with at least 200 instances of collaboration are shown in the visualisation. Nodes are sized by the total number of collaborations with institutions from other countries. Countries have been colour coded by World Bank Income Classification. These networks may serve as an indicator of countries’ investments in international collaboration and marine research capacity development, alongside their willingness and, crucially, capacity to collaborate internationally.\n\ncountry = await FileAttachment(\"data/country_network_june.json\").json();\n\ncountry_code = function() {\n    var [option, myChart] = this.getVars();\n\n    myChart.showLoading();\n\n    var graph = country;\n\n    myChart.hideLoading();\n\n    graph.nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n        node.label = {\n            show: node.symbolSize &gt; 0\n        };\n    });\n\n    option = {\n        tooltip: {},\n        legend: [{\n            selectedMode: false, //'multiple',\n            data: graph.categories.map(function(a) {\n                return a.name;\n            })//,\n            //hoverLink: false\n        }],\n        animationDuration: 0,\n        animationEasingUpdate: 'quinticInOut',\n        series: [{\n            name: 'Countries',\n            type: 'graph',\n            layout: 'circular',\n            circular: {\n                rotateLabel: true\n            },\n            data: graph.nodes,\n            links: graph.links,\n            categories: [\n                {\n                    name: 'Low income',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#9400D3' //Dark Violet\n                        //'#21523a',\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'High income',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#000080' //Navy blue\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'Lower middle income',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#DAA520' //Goldenrod\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'Upper middle income',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#DC143C' //Crimson red\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'Unclassified',\n                    itemStyle: {\n                        color: '#228B22' // Forest green\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            roam: true,\n            scaleLimit: {\n                min: 0.8, // minimum zoom level (0.5 means the chart can be zoomed out to half its original size)\n                max: 1.5   // maximum zoom level (2 means the chart can be zoomed in to twice its original size)\n            },\n            zoom: 0.9,\n            label: {\n                position: 'right',\n                formatter: '{b}',\n                color: 'inherit',\n                fontSize: 10\n            },\n            lineStyle: {\n                //color: '#7d84e3',\n                color: 'source',\n                opacity: 0.05,\n                curveness: 0.3\n            },\n            force: {\n                repulsion: 80,\n                edgeLength: 100\n            },\n            emphasis: {\n                focus: 'adjacency',//'series', //\n                lineStyle: {\n                    width: 10\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    };\n\n    option && myChart.setOption(option);\n}\n\nnew EchartsRunner()\n  .addCodes(country_code)\n  .show();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: The international collaboration network of all countries with over 200 publications\nAccording to our data, researchers from the United States have the highest rate of collaboration with other countries, with 48,156 instances of collaboration encompassing all countries with over 200 marine biodiversity related publications. Figure 14 shows the collaboration network for the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: The international collaboration network of the United States\nThe countries with the lowest number of international collaborations are the Low income country Madagascar, with 201 instances of collaboration and the Lower middle income country Senegal, with 203 instances of collaboration. Figure 15 shows the countries Malagasy researchers have collaborated with. Figure 16 shows the same for Senegal. It is clear from these figures that even countries with relatively few collaborations may still work with researchers from a diverse range of countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: The international collaboration network of Madagascar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: The international collaboration network of Senegal\nIn considering this data we would emphasise that as more data on author affiliations becomes available a clearer view is likely to emerge of country collaboration networks.\n\n\nFunding\nWithin scientific publications, funding information has typically been provided by researchers in the free form acknowledgements section.7 This often results in data that is unstructured and challenging to process. As discussed in Valuing the Deep, databases began incorporating the option to include funding details from the mid to late 2000s onwards. Since then, funding agencies have placed a greater emphasis on the inclusion of funding details in publications arising from their financial support. Recent additions to databases like OpenAlex include new funder identifiers to better link funding entities with publications. Yet, the data is still sparse. For instance, of the 476,661 publications in the marine dataset discussed here, only 55,700 (11.6%) contain funding details. Nonetheless, given the increasing importance of this data to funding bodies, which are accountable to taxpayers, we anticipate a future rise in the availability of such information. Figure 17 presents a summary of the available data on funding by organisation, country and the year relevant articles were published. We also include available data on trends in open access (orange) and closed access (blue) publications linked to funding data in OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: This figure shows available information for marine biodiversity related publications in a set of 55,700 publications as well as trends in the publications that include funding information. Data on trends in Open Access publications suggests that funding agencies increasingly promote and require open access publications.\nWhen considering Figure 17 and further visualisations of funding data it is important to note that the sparsity of the data means that we are ‘seeing through a glass darkly’. Caution is therefore encouraged in drawing conclusions about funding for marine biodiversity research in general or deep-sea research specifically. However, this data is valuable in highlighting the major funding agencies for marine biodiversity-related research and in identifying emerging funding networks. As discussed in Valuing the Deep, these networks are often invisible to funding agencies and to the wider research community.\nNote that the funding programmes of the European Union such as the Framework and more recent Horizon programmes are listed separately in the OpenAlex funding table, diminishing the visibility of the EU as a major funder of research in Figure 17.\nIt is possible to create collaboration networks for funding institutions showing which funding institutions have funded the same research publications. Figure 18 illustrates the primary collaboration links between funding agencies supporting more than 50 publications of marine biodiversity-related research.\n\nnew_funder = await FileAttachment(\"data/funders_june_countries2.json\").json();\n\nfunder_code = function() {\n    var [option, myChart] = this.getVars();\n\n    myChart.showLoading();\n\n    var graph = new_funder;\n\n    myChart.hideLoading();\n\n    graph.nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n        node.label = {\n            show: node.symbolSize &gt; 8\n        };\n    });\n\n    option = {\n        // title: {\n        //     text: 'Funder',\n        //     subtext: 'Default layout',\n        //     top: 'bottom',\n        //     left: 'right'\n        // },\n        tooltip: {},\n         legend: {\n             selectedMode: 'multiple',\n             data: graph.categories.filter(function(a) {\n                 return [\"European Union\", \"China\", \"Japan\", \"Russia\", \"Korea, Rep.\", \"United States\"].includes(a.name);\n             }).map(function(a) {\n                 return a.name;\n             }),\n             left: 'left'\n         },\n        animation: false,\n        //animationDuration: 400,\n        //animationEasingUpdate: 'quinticInOut',\n        series: [{\n            name: 'Funders',\n            type: 'graph',\n            layout: 'force',\n            data: graph.nodes,\n            links: graph.links,\n            categories: graph.categories,\n            roam: true,\n            scaleLimit: {\n                min: 0.7, // minimum zoom level (0.5 means the chart can be zoomed out to half its original size)\n                max: 1.5   // maximum zoom level (2 means the chart can be zoomed in to twice its original size)\n            },\n            zoom: 1,\n            label: {\n                position: 'right',\n                formatter: '{b}',\n                backgroundColor: '#fff', \n                borderColor: '#fff',  // Add border to labels\n                borderWidth: 3\n                //padding: [10, 10, 10, 10] Doesn't seem to be doing anything\n            },\n            labelLayout: {\n                hideOverlap: true\n            },\n            lineStyle: {\n                color: 'source',\n                opacity: 0.2,\n                curveness: 0.3\n            },\n            // force: {\n            //   repulsion: 25,\n            //   edgeLength: 40\n            //},\n            force: {\n                repulsion: [400, 800],\n                edgeLength: [100, 300]\n            },\n            emphasis: {\n                focus: 'adjacency',\n                lineStyle: {\n                    width: 10\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    };\n\n    option && myChart.setOption(option);\n}\n\nnew EchartsRunner()\n  .addCodes(funder_code)\n  .show();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Collaboration network of major funders of marine biodiversity research.\nFigure 19 shows the funding collaboration network for the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the funder of the most publications (9577) with the most collaborations (7496).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Funding collaboration network of the National Natural Science Foundation of China\nFigure 20 presents the network for the European Union. Note that in this visualisation EU programmes such as Erasmus+, Horizon 2020, and the 7th Framework Programme have been collectively attributed to the European Union to ensure their visibility. This may obscure relationships between individual EU programmes. Similarly, the way authors submit funding information may produce a comparable effect for the National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Funding collaboration network of the European Union\n\n\nAuthors\nResearch on marine biodiversity and the deep sea is made possible by individual researchers, research teams, and the relationships between them. Therefore, it is important to examine how these researchers and their relationships appear in the data, as summarised in Figure 21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: This figure shows rankings of authors by the number of papers involving marine biodiversity in the citation graph.\nThese author rankings do not necessarily show the full research output of any individual researcher. Rather they display the output of researchers within the biodiversity graph. They serve both to highlight the importance of marine researchers and the topics they cover and to test the coverage of the graph. In the upper rankings we would expect to see senior researchers who are well known in marine biology or closely related fields. Note that author rankings are affected by the availability of data and a known issue arising from naming conventions in East Asia and elsewhere is that author names of distinct persons may become conflated.\nWe can gain an appreciation of the diversity of researchers and their research by selecting a sample of researchers’ profiles. Other than brief comments we will allow these to speak for themselves. We include titles in the display to illustrate the topics addressed by individual authors. The most prolific author within this dataset is Jehee Lee from Jeju National University in the Republic of Korea as shown in Figure 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: This figure offers insights into the publication history of Jehee Lee, who has frequently published on subjects relating to marine biodiversity.\nProfessor Lee’s profile reveals an interest in the active properties of a range of marine organisms including marine snails (abalone), clams, the rock bream, mullet and marine bacteria. In practice, our marine biodiversity graph captures only part of Professor Lee’s overall publication portfolio; any publications which do not meet the criteria for the biodiversity graph will have been excluded.\nFigure 23 shows the profile of Professor Eric Kandel, whose research focuses on neuroscience, memory and sea slugs (Aplysia). Professor Kandel was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000 and his research has focused on a number of different marine invertebrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: This figure offers insights into the publication history of Eric Kandel, who has frequently published on subjects related to marine biodiversity.\nThe vital role women play in marine scientific research is reflected in the work of Rita Colwell (Figure 24), who conducted her Ph.D. research in aquatic microbiology and would go on to focus in detail on Vibrio and Vibrio cholerea. Professor Colwell was the first woman to be appointed as the Director of the National Science Foundation. A wider view of the contributions of women to men in marine scientific research could be gained by calculating the ratio of women to men in the field. However, the analysis of person names by sex or gender in multiple languages is not straightforward and fuller exploration of the contribution of women to marine scientific research is therefore a topic for future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: This figure offers insights into the publication history of Rita Colwell, who has frequently published on subjects related to marine biodiversity.\nFinally, it is also important to emphasise, as discussed in depth in the WIPO landscape on marine genetic resources, that researchers from developing countries are also very active in marine research as Figure 8 has already revealed.\nProfessor Baldomero Olivera is originally from the Philippines and has mainly pursued his career at the University of Utah. His profile within the marine graph is displayed in Figure 25. Professor Olivera’s research has focused on marine cone snail toxins that have proved to be a rich source of pharmacologically active peptides (see Oldham, Shale and Kindness 2019). Professor Olivera has collaborated closely with Professor Lourdes Cruz at the University of the Philippines Diliman and shared the 2022 AAAS “Golden Goose” award for obscure federally sponsored research that produced unlikely and unexpected benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: This figure offers insights into the publication history of Baldomero Olivera, who has frequently published on subjects related to marine biodiversity.\n\n\nApplied Research\nAs we have already seen in the brief researcher profiles, potential practical applications have been a central focus of research on marine organisms. We can gain a clearer view of applied research using information on chemical compounds for the records available through the Lens Scholarly API service as set out in Figure 26. The data is limited to publications that appear in the PubMed database for biomedically focused research. PubMed applies the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) classification. This data is available for 136,982 of the publications in the dataset and will not cover publications outside PubMed.\nFigure 26 reveals a range of different topics that are important in marine research, such as work on water pollutants. Figure 26 focuses on research on marine organisms for anti-cancer (anti-neoplastic) agents and highlights the main research topics, the organisms involved such as Dolabella auricularia or the dodge sea hare as well as the institutions involved in research publications on anti-cancer agents.\nSo far we have focused on providing a general portrait for marine biodiversity research using a citation graph based approach. We will now focus specifically on research in ABNJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Supplementary information on chemical substances is available for 136,982 publications and is limited to publications appearing PubMed (biomedically focused research) that uses the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) classification.",

    "section": "Defining the Deep Sea",
    "text": "Defining the Deep Sea\nThe Valuing the Deep study highlighted the primary analytical challenge of differentiating between samples collected within national jurisdictions and those sourced from the High Seas. In simpler terms, the fundamental question posed is: where was this sample obtained from? The proposition for the BBNJ unique standardised batch identifier, as outlined in the new BBNJ Treaty, offers a resolution to this dilemma by introducing a straightforward batch identifier for samples collected from the High Seas. Once applied to samples collected on a research cruise, or an undersea installation, the identifier cascades into collections, databases of digital objects such as digital sequence information, publications and patents.\nIn the interim before the identifier becomes operational, we are confronted with the challenge of distinguishing between research on marine biodiversity and genetic resources in general and that conducted specifically within the High Seas. Valuing the Deep approached this challenge by combining data from different specialist databases and OBIS. An updated version of that approach centres around crafting a working definition of High Seas research based on scoreable parameters.\nOne advantage of a working definition approach is that the parameters can be adjusted and updated as more data becomes available and experience is generated in use of the definition. Second, a working definition enjoys the benefit of methodological transparency by clearly outlining the parameters and data sources utilised in defining High Seas research. Another potential advantage is that it may be applicable both inside and outside of scientific literature. Finally, the working definition can serve as an intermediate step until such time that the BBNJ identifier comes into operation. The working definition, insofar that it succeeds in isolating high seas research, can then assist in developing experiments to test data capture using the batch identifier prior to its full roll out through the Clearing House Mechanism. As such, in the interim period leading to the entry into force of the treaty a working definition can also contribute to testing out how the batch identifier will work in practice.\nThe working definition consists of the three main elements:\n\nA) Named Places\nA number of dictionaries are available with the coordinates of named places in the world’s oceans, these include:\n\nThe General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Gazetteer created by the International Hydrographic Organisation and UNESCO, which is the key authoritative resource for named underwater places.\nThe InterRidge vents database for hydrothermal vents.\nThe Seamounts Online database with names and coordinates for seamounts (discontinued)\nThe Geonames public contribution dataset of underwater place names (terrestrial aquatic and marine)\nCoordinates for Cold Water Corals including named places (e.g.seamounts)\n\nWe can visually illustrate the application of this approach using geographic place names. Figure 27 displays the coordinates for 17,777 distinct named places and 22,921 variant names derived from the sources noted above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27: A compilation of 17,777 named underwater places with coordinates from four sources. Large features in the GEBCO Gazetteer such as ridges, trenches etc. have been reduced to their centroid coordinates.\nIn considering Figure 27 it is important to note that some of the named places may appear in freshwater terrestrial settings. These are mainly from the open access Geonames dataset and include, for example, subglacial basins in Antarctica and are derived from entries coded U for Undersea in Geonames or appearing in the Geonames ‘no country’ dataset. Other named places are found in lakes and rivers.\nThe GEBCO Gazetteer includes coordinates for large features such as seamounts, ridges and troughs in the form of line strings, polygons and multipolygons. For these larger features we use the geometric centroid because it allows us to aggregate records to the named place. In a small number of cases this may lead to duplication of a named place (where a point is provided in the underlying data and we use a centroid). We also note that it is possible that for large geological features it is possible that some parts of the feature will fall inside the EEZ while other parts fall into ABNJ. Cases where this could apply have not been identified.\nNamed underwater places share the characteristic that they have commonly been given multiple names or variants of names in multiple languages. In some datasets these are referred to as preferred names with synonyms. Wherever possible we retain the variants of names which will be aggregated to the same data point. We awarded unique identifiers to each place and its corresponding variant to allow the data to be aggregated.\nThe use of named places with coordinates allows the relationship between a named place and the EEZ (taken as a single global entity) to be calculated using the Marine Regions EEZ map. This is achieved by calculating those coordinates that fall inside the global EEZ and those that fall into ABNJ. Figure 28 shows the impact of this approach. Note that the Marine Regions map of the global EEZ includes an EEZ around Antarctica which is not correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 28: Named marine places that are located in the EEZ and ABNJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: Named marine places that are located in the High Seas (ABNJ).\nFigure 29 shows the impact of removing those named places falling inside the EEZ from the display.\nIn total this approach identified 3,029 places in the High Seas associated with 4,397 names including name variants. Note that because Antarctica is represented on the Marine Regions shapefile as possessing an EEZ we will undercount named places in ABNJ for the waters around Antarctica.\n\n\nB) Dictionaries of Terms\nDictionaries of terms can be used to search the scientific literature, patents and web pages. These include:\n\nUnderwater features at varying levels of detail (e.g.the water column, hydrothermal vent(s), seabed, seamounts or guyots, mud volcanoes, cold seeps, cold water corals, depth characteristics such as pelagic, mesopelagic, hadal etc.). Underwater features are mainly derived from the generic term field in the GEBCO Gazetteer.\nDeep sea terms that are widely used in the high seas research literature (e.g. deep sea, deepsea, deep-sea, high seas, ABNJ etc).\nAn Oceans dictionary for the world’s major oceans.\nA Seas dictionary containing names of the world’s seas, which are typically inside national jurisdiction. This can be used for the purposes of excluding records.\n\nDictionary based approaches are relatively simple. The Features dictionary was compiled from the GEBCO Gazetteer generic names values (e.g. seamount) with additions from a review of top feature related words and phrases that appear in the marine dataset (single words and phrases). Dictionaries of the World’s Oceans and Seas are available through the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Limits of Oceans and Seas (3rd edition, 1953). At this stage we focused only on compiling terms in English with terms in other languages to be added at a later date if it proves useful to further pursue the working definition.\nFigure 30 showcases the outcomes of entity extraction using a dictionary, represented as the number of publications in the marine set. It is worth noting that, as is often the case, some terms will prove to be noisy and necessitate further review for possible exclusion (e.g. ‘the gut’, ‘the gap’ etc.) while other terms could benefit from further aggregation. Manual review and refinement of terms is crucial to ensure precise data capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30: Illustrative rankings of document counts from dictionaries\n\n\nC) Taxonomic Records\nTaxonomic records are typically found in OBIS and include:\n\nSpecies occurrence records with coordinates for organisms in ABNJ. This is in effect, a calculation on OBIS occurrence records. OBIS currently lists 8.9 million occurrence records for 27,740 species and 38,546 taxa for ABNJ.\nOrganisms listed in OBIS as deep sea organisms through the World Register of Deep Sea Species (WoRDSS, now part of WoRMS which contributes to OBIS).\nTaxa appearing in the Chessbase database for organisms from deep sea chemosynthetic environments and recorded in OBIS.\nEntries marked as ‘High Seas’ by researchers and publishers contributing to OBIS.\n\nOne benefit of a working definition approach is that records can be scored based on whether they meet TRUE/FALSE criteria, and those scores can be weighted in different ways to reflect their importance.\nFor example, what we call GEBCO feature terms are individual words that describe an underwater feature such as ‘vent’, ‘trough’, ‘trench’, ‘ridge’, ‘column’ and ‘zone’. Some of these terms, such as vent, are quite distinctive but others may be in very widespread use, such as column (for column chromatography) or zone (e.g. for the zone of a gene or genome). As such, some individual terms that describe features may be very noisy in nature and therefore merit a lower weighted score.\nIn contrast, feature words are precise underwater place names that are situated in ABNJ. Where a record contains an ABNJ place name it is virtually certain that the record involves research in the high seas. The measure therefore merits the highest weighted score.\nOther measures within the working definition, notably taxonomic names, are more ambiguous due to ambiguity in the underlying data. For example, the OBIS use of a marine label for data does not in reality mean that a particular species is exclusively marine. Similarly, the calculation that a species only occurs in ABNJ using OBIS data is unlikely to fully hold true. A case in point is Trichoderma harzianum, a fungus that is found in marine environments but is widespread in other environments. In OBIS data this fungus is labelled as marine only and is also recorded in the OBIS data for ABNJ. As such, the fungus will wrongly receive a high score across multiple measures in the working definition.\nAs noted above, species occurrence records for deep sea organisms can be identified in OBIS data for Chessbase and WoRDSS. In addition, as noted above, in its public interface OBIS currently lists 8.9 million occurrence records for 27,740 species and 38,546 taxa for ABNJ. We further restricted the data to marine only organisms by filtering out taxa with records from terrestrial, brackish or freshwater environments. We also filtered out any records with a continent, country, state province, municipality or similar code. The results are set out in Figure 31.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 31: OBIS Occurrence Records in ABNJ\nThe application of these filters reduced the number of taxonomic names to 7,982 in 1,477,285 occurrence records as shown in Table 3. We refer to this as the ‘ABNJ only’ group as a working set consisting of 6,203 unique binomial names and 1,779 higher order or uninomial taxonomic names. The latter are likely to encompass organisms found in multiple environments.\nTable 3: Occurrence Rankings for Marine Organisms in ABNJ by number of occurrence records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top organisms in Table 3 in terms of the number of occurrences are Antarctic krill, Bigeye tuna, Swordfish, the Copepod Calanus finmarchicus found mainly in the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean Copepod Calanus simillimus along with other krill species such as Thysanoessa macrura and Copepod Rhincalanus gigas.\nThis indicates that organisms that are recorded with high frequency in ABNJ are typically found in shallower waters and, in the case of krill, tuna and swordfish, will be commercially significant for fisheries.\nTaken together, the combination of working definition elements provides a structured way of focusing analysis on research in the High Seas.",

    "section": "Applying the Working Definition",
    "text": "Applying the Working Definition\nThe three categories of data identified above are used to construct a working definition with weighted scores. Table 4 sets out the criteria and weighted scores for the working definition.\nTable 4: Weighted Criteria for the Working Definition with explanatory notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5 shows examples of matching scientific publications against the weighted criteria mentioned above. The figure shows the OpenAlex publication identifier, the total score of the record against the criteria and a selection of columns.\nTable 5: Weighted criteria applied to individual records (selection for display).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ranked totals for the criteria across the dataset are summarised in Table 6.\nTable 6: Marine Working Definition Rankings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn interpreting Table 6 we can immediately observe that the majority of the overall marine dataset falls within the group 1 range of the working definition. That is, the records, even where they involve a marine organism do not contain a reference to a marine feature, or place name that would move them out of the group 1 range under the weighted criteria. Two large groupings of publications are found in groups 2 and 3 respectively and are dominated by members of Vibrio, Trichoderma and Mytilus as well as White Spot Syndrome Virus (affecting shrimp) as well as a range of plants such as the algae Dunaliella salina and the seagrass Posidonia oceanica.\nA distinctive cluster of documents emerges in Group 5. Taken together Group 4 to 10 consist of 26,413 documents and will be our focus.\n\nLevel 4 and Above\nA focus on records with a score of 4 or above limits the dataset to 26,413 records in total representing 5.5% of the overall raw marine dataset. Figure 32 displays the top organisms meeting these criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Marine Species and Uninomial Names (n = 26,413)\nAt this level, the focus has narrowed considerably to species associated with the oceans and ABNJ. Prominent species include the copepod Calanus finmarchicus which is widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean. The second highest ranked species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The prominence of the widely distributed fungus Cladosporium herbarum, a common allergen, could initially be dismissed as the intrusion of noise except for the commercial interest in marine Cladosporium as a source of novel metabolites with a range of potential applications.8 Further down the rankings, we find the red seabream (Pargus major) as a commercially important fish species, the Norwegian lobster Nephrops norvegicus and Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. This suggests that while the focus is narrowing we will observe a mix of marine organisms from the EEZ and ABNJ.\nFigure 33 displays trends in publications at rank 4 and above and the top concepts associated with publications. Note here that a very distinct trough appears in the data that is assumed to reflect the absence of open access forms of abstracts in Open Alex rather than a decline in activity.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33: Overview of Research Activity at Rank 4 and Above (n = 26,413)\nIn considering data by country, note that we observe a similar pattern to the more general marine data, except that China appears to become less prominent as the working definition takes us into deeper waters inside the EEZ and into BBNJ. This pattern is reflected in the available data on author affiliations for publications where we can also observe that the University of Sao Paulo is moving up the rankings. We would caution however, that these changes could reflect gaps in the availability of affiliation data in the publication dataset where 355,270 of the 476,661 records contain country information. In total, 16,325 records (61%) of the 26,413 publications at level 4 and above possess country affiliation information and 10,088 do not.\nA wider view of trends in activity by country and United Nations Region is provided in Figure 34. All major world regions continue to be represented. The proportion of participation, measured as a percentage share of publications reveals potentially interesting features. Thus, across the 355,270 publications in the raw marine graph with country data, countries in the Africa region accrued 12,967 publications (3.65% of the total). At level 4 and above we observe participation by Africa in 515 publications representing 3.15% . A similar pattern where regions appear to hold their share with some minor variation is also suggested in this data. This could be interpreted as meaning that as research moves into deeper waters, it does not necessarily follow that the participation of developing countries decreases radically (expressed in terms of publications). However, the gaps in affiliation country information mean that it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion about this data, expect that a more nuanced interpretation of country participation in marine research in ABNJ may be possible. Furthermore, it is desirable to promote the inclusion of country information for all authors to provide a clearer view in future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 34: Trends in Activity by Country and UN Regions and Sub-Regions (n = 26,413 of which 16,325 have country information)\nFigure 35 displays an overview of author rankings for the data at level 4 and above. This is mainly intended to assist with community sanity checking of the data at different levels but also to highlight that contributions to marine scientific research ultimately originate from the work of individual researchers and research teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 35: Authors Profile for Level 4 and Above (n = 26,413)\nThe top ranking authors in the level 4 data include Gregg Rouse at the Scripps Institute who has published on topics such as bone eating worms and more broadly on the phylogeny of a range of marine organisms. Guillermo San Martin from the Autonomous University of Madrid has published extensively on new species and annelids. Tetsuya Komori and Ryota Higuchi have jointly published on glycosides from starfish (Asteroidea). The Dutch marine biologist R.W.M van Soest is a specialist in sponges (Porifera) while Joan Enric Cartes is a specialist in the ecology of deep-sea ecosystems in the Mediterranean and Atlantic.\nA brief review of the titles of publications in Figure 35 suggests that we are still in the realms of a mix of EEZ and BBNJ publications.\nFigure 36 displays the available data from publications appearing in PubMed on chemical compounds that are a focus of research (based on MeSH terms). Figure 36 suggests the dominance of research on the identification of bacteria at level 4 (marked by the prominence of 16S Ribosomal RNA in the rankings).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 36:: Available data on Medical Subject Headings For Level 4 and Above\nIn considering the data in Figure 36 we see an emphasis on basic research including classification as well as references in the more detailed topic qualifiers to isolation and purification, pharmacology and enzymology suggesting applied research. Albeit at a lower level (not shown), the titles of publications also suggest a growing focus on hydrothermal vents in a range of different areas, including work on a candidate new species of epibiont living on the deep-sea hydrothermal vent shrimp Rimicaris exoculata.\nAs we narrow the focus to level 6 and above in the working definition, these trends will become more prominent.\n\n\nLevel 6 and Above\nAt level 6 and above the data narrows considerably to 1,749 records. This makes up 0.3% of the overall marine dataset.\nAt level 6 and above, Figure 37 reveals that the taxonomic data narrows on the species level to Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the blind shrimp Rimicaris exoculata which is found in abundance at hydrothermal vents in the mid-Atlantic ridge, the bivalve Bathymodiolus azoricus found at vent sites in the Azores Triple Junction and Logatchev hydrothermal vent field, the polycheate Pompeii worm Alvinella pompejana found at vent sites in the Pacific Ocean, and the Giant Tube Worm Riftia pachyptila first described in 1981 at a Galapagos Rift vent site.10 Other species that emerge in this data include the abyssal grenadier fish Coryphaenoides armatus found at depth in many of the world’s oceans and the deepwater mussel Bathymodiolus thermophilus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 37: Overview of Species and Uninomial names in Publication Rankings at Level 6 and above (n = 1,749)\nFigure 38 reveals a peak of 61 publications in 2008. With respect to Concepts we begin to see ‘Hydrothermal Circulation’ and ‘Hydrothermal vent’ are rising rapidly up the rankings. The relative country rankings also begin to change, with France moving up in position and countries such as Brazil and China (among others) beginning to drop down the rankings. This is also reflected in the relative positions of organisations in the affiliations, with two French organisations taking a clear lead followed by an Oceanology Institute in Russia. Here we would note that it is important not to read too much into these rankings given the limitations of available affiliation data. Nevertheless, level 6 and above in the working definition appears to mark a transition point towards institutions and research teams specialising in deep sea research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 38: Overview of Species and Uninomial Publication Rankings at Level 6 and above (n = 1,749, 1,212 with affiliation country data)\nFigure 39 displays a detailed breakout of publication activity by country with percentage shares of publications by UN regions and sub-regions.\nIn considering the country rankings we observe that the US remains the single standout country. However, Europe’s share of activity is increasing. Latin America and the Caribbean are holding their position. South-East Asia shows a decline in its share. Oceania’s share increases and also narrows in terms of the participation of researchers from the Oceania sub-regions being limited to Australia & New Zealand and Melanesia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 39: Publication Rankings by Country and UN Region at Level 6 and above (n = 1,749, 1,212 with affiliation country data)\nFigure 40 displays authors ranked by publication at level 6 and above in the working definition. The publication counts have a narrow range and this measure is intended to highlight that marine scientific research is conducted by real people and teams and to encourage community suggestions for improvements to the working definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 40: Publication Rankings by Authors at Level 6 and above (n = 1,749, 1,212 with affiliation country data)\nAt this level we observe researchers including Didier Jollivet with the CNRS who works on the nucleotide diversity of annelid worms in extreme environments. We also observe Michel Segonzac at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, Pierre-Marie Sarradin who leads the Deep Sea Ecosystems Research Unit at IFREMER and Daniel Desbruyères who also specialises in deep sea ecosystems at IFREMER. Elsewhere in the table Francoise Gaill is a senior deep sea biologist at CNRS who has conducted pioneering research on hydrothermal vents while Paul Tyler is a deep ocean specialist and Emeritus Professor in Ocean and Earth Science at the National Oceanography Centre Southampton. Looking beyond France and the UK we also observe Andrey Gebruk of the P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology specialising in hydrothermal shrimp, Timothy Shank at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute focusing on the ecology of deep-ocean benthic ecosystems and Hiromi Watanabe at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science Technology whose research topics include genetic divergence and migration patterns.\nOf particular interest at this level is the prominent work of women scientists including Angelika Brandt at Goethe University Frankfurt specialising in deep sea biodiversity in Antarctica, Cindy Lee Van Dover at Duke who pioneered research on hydrothermal vents, Nadine Le Bris at Sorbonne University specialising in chemosynthetic communities and Jozee Sarazin at IFREMER researching deep benthos assemblages.\nIn total, and prior to data cleaning, over 4,000 researchers appear on publications at level 6 and above suggesting that while the number of researchers who actively conduct research in the deep oceans may be limited, they form part of extensive networks.\nFigure 41 displays the available data from medical subject headings at level 6 and above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 41: Publication Rankings involving Chemical Compounds at level 6 and above (n = 3,189)\nThis suggests that we have indeed progressed into the deep oceans through the references to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and to hydrothermal vents. Our aim has been to progressively refine the focus from general marine biodiversity, through research in the deep oceans inside the EEZ and ABNJ towards research conducted in ABNJ.",

    "text": "Named Places in ABNJ in the Scientific Literature\nThe working definition presented above reveals that a fundamental precondition for the identification of research activity in BBNJ in the absence of the BBNJ batch identifier is the presence of a reference to a named place. A named place may be a Sea that is entirely within BBNJ such as the Ross, Weddell or Sargasso Seas or, more usually, a named underwater place from the GEBCO Gazetteer, seamount, hydrothermal vent or cold water coral datasets.\nFigure 42 shows the results of mapping named underwater places in the scientific literature in accordance with whether a named place appears inside the EEZ or in ABNJ. The data includes a small number of place names that appear in the scientific literature but do not appear in the reference sets. The latter were geocoded using the Google Maps API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 42: Named Underwater Places in the Scientific Literature in the EEZ and ABNJ\n\nIn total we identified 7,204 publications for marine organisms involving 607 underwater places either in the EEZ or ABNJ.

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis presented here is, to our knowledge, the second in depth analysis of research activity in ABNJ following the earlier Valuing the Deep study. As this analysis has made clear, what has changed in the intervening decade is the ability of the research community to access data on the scientific literature at scale and to combine data from different sources (notably taxonomic data from OBIS and GBIF as well as geographic data) in ways that were previously very difficult to achieve at scale. In part these advances are made possible by the use of machine learning models to automate named entity recognition at the scale of hundreds of millions of documents. At the same time, the rise of Large Language Models (as we demonstrate later) provides, subject to appropriate quality controls, important opportunities to automate elements of data retrieval and analysis that must presently be conducted by humans.\nThe analysis in this section also exposes the ongoing challenges in large scale bibliometric analysis. These challenges are not specific to research on BBNJ but are worth noting as: incomplete access to data to facilitate statistical analysis of trends, and; incomplete data on author affiliations and funders. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise that the situation is much improved both in terms of the quantity and quality of data available and in the availability of tools to work with data at scale.\nA main focus of this discussion has been to advance the idea of a working definition for research in ABNJ consisting of a weighted multi-criteria matrix for identifying research that is more likely to be taking place in BBNJ. The experimental approach to the working definition presented here is intended to bridge the gap, and contribute to the assessment of, the eventual roll out of the BBNJ standardised batch identifier established under the Treaty. In concrete terms, in the intervening period before the deployment of the batch identifier, we anticipate that the working definition could be further refined and its use automated for retrieving research relevant to the Treaty and its scientific community. The working definition and data presented here could also contribute to piloting the identifier and to the eventual assessment of the effectiveness of the identifier in capturing research conducted in BBNJ. Put in other terms, the working definition can serve as a useful temporary stop-gap measure in capturing marine research in BBNJ and provide useful points of reference in constructing a better way forward.",

    "text": "The Patent Data\nWe used the ABSPAT patent index developed by One World Analytics as the basis for the analysis. The ABSPAT index is an index of biodiversity relevant entities, consisting of taxonomic names, common names, virus names, habitats, country and place names that appear in the full text of the patent documents from the European Patent Office (EPO), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Patent Cooperation Treaty published between 1976 and the present (currently, to the end of December 2023). These offices are major drivers of the global patent system and patent applicants will typically file in multiple countries for inventions that are economically important to them. The focus on these three offices is intended to capture claimed inventions that are internationally important. For example, in focusing on the United States approximately 40% of patent filings with the USPTO originate from applicants outside the United States. In Europe, the European Patent Convention is the key vehicle for securing protection across its 39 member states. The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is administered by WIPO and is the main vehicle for the pursuit of patent protection worldwide. This approach is not intended to capture patent activity for purely domestic markets (e.g.not pursued in other markets outside the home market). The approach is similar to that pioneered by the OECD in focusing its statistical indicators on the US, the EPC and Japan (known as the Trilateral Offices) with the exception that biodiversity based analysis is dependent on access to the full texts of patent documents.2 At the time of writing, the ABSPAT index contained 1.4 million biodiversity related first filings of patent applications linked to 10.9 million patent family members worldwide.\nAs discussed in detail in the 2019 WIPO Patent Landscape Report on Marine Genetic Resources, our ability to conduct analysis across all countries worldwide is heavily constrained by access to national collections in public or private databases.3 For example, the patent collections for India and ASEAN countries are only partially accessible and are under-represented in statistical databases such as the EPO World Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT). As such, it is important to recognise the constraints imposed by lack of access to national patent collections for patent analysis. In addition, the diversity of languages that may be used within the global patent system is also a limiting factor. However, while noting these data constraints, the ability to map patent families worldwide using PATSTAT provides important opportunities to understand trends in global demand across countries for marine genetic resources and those from ABNJ. Readers interested in gaining an in depth understanding of the methods used in this study should consult the second edition of the WIPO Manual on Open Source Patent Analytics for beginners and the WIPO Patent Analytics Handbook for intermediate and advanced users.\nFor the purpose of consistency, the same basic methodology is applied to the patent data as for the scientific literature considered in the previous section. In this case the available full texts of patent documents relevant to biodiversity, consisting of the titles, abstracts, descriptions and claims are broken down into individual sentences and processed using the Humboldt Named Entity Recognition model. Patent full texts are sourced using the Lens patent API from the non-profit CAMBIA in Australia. The results of the text analysis are joined to the EPO Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) as the international gold standard for patent statistics. The results are also federated with other datasets, notably the taxonomic backbone of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and OBIS, and filtered down to marine organisms. The use of sentence level analysis allows for fine grained analysis of the presence of marine resources in conjunction with other information, such as known underwater features and locations.",

This stands in contrast with DOCDB or ‘simple’ families where only the Paris priority is used. The effect is that counts of first filings are lower using INPADOC families because they ‘see’ relationships that are not visible using ‘simple’ families but the corresponding number of INPADOC family members is also often larger for the same reason. The terms ‘simple’ and ‘extended’ families are sometimes used to describe this but caution is required because different data providers may mean different things when using the same or similar terms.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this section we explore the appearance of marine genetic resources on the internet. The internet is a primary source of public information about marine organisms, compounds and products. However, as of January/February 2023 there are approximately 3.15 billion publicly accessible web pages corresponding with 400 Terabytes of data that are archived by the non-profit Common Crawl. This figure only includes publicly available web pages and does not include those that are in some way protected (e.g. requiring a username and password or not indexed by search engines).\nThe challenge therefore is to identify useful information on marine genetic resources from ABNJ, particularly information relating to commercialisation, in a structured way.\nIn this section we explore different resources and approaches that can assist with enhancing transparency on the utilisation of marine genetic resources in general and marine genetic resources from ABNJ in particular. In doing so, we highlight two recent examples. The first of these is the existence of the Common Crawl as an open access archive of the public internet that is widely used to train Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and many others. Second, we explore the opportunities to automate monitoring of activity involving marine genetic resources at scale represented by combining traditional web research techniques with the AI models to create specialised research agents for specific tasks. We note that the increasing availability of public snapshots of the internet for research purposes presents major opportunities for enhancing transparency on the utilisation of marine genetic resources from ABNJ. However, the challenges involved in interrogating web data at scale, and across multiple languages, mean that these opportunities will be best realised through the assistance of AI models. This in turn will raise questions on how to ensure best practice in:\nWe begin our analysis with a brief introduction to snapshots of the internet, the use of these snapshots in AI and the presence of the marine environment in web snapshot data.",

    "text": "Snapshots of the Web\nThe emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) to public prominence from late 2022 onwards has led to questions increasingly being asked about the sources of training data that power the creation of these models. This can readily lead to the assumption that individual companies are involved in indexing and scraping the internet when in practice the majority of companies will use the public access Common Crawl.\nCommon Crawl is a US registered non-profit organisation that began collecting public web data from 2008 onwards and made its first release of a public snapshot in 2011 and as a public dataset hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 20121. While the Common Crawl itself is released under a public domain waiver it contains copyrighted material. In the United States use of the Common Crawl can be considered under the protected principle of fair use doctrine while the situation varies in other jurisdictions. Recent legal cases involving copyright and Large Language Models trained on the Common Crawl are likely to clarify the situation in a number of different jurisdictions.\nThe Common Crawl is an example of a widespread practice known as web scraping, exemplified by the work of large companies such as Google in indexing the internet to power search engines and the practices of specialised companies such as market research companies in providing specialist services. Our ability to rapidly find information on the internet would not exist without website indexing and associated scraping of web pages.\nHowever, the scraping of web pages also involves a number of concerns, such as obtaining confidential or personal information (e.g. by accessing specific or protected areas of web sites without permission or harvesting the names of persons from public sites). In response, there are a number of now long standing practices that facilitate the use of web pages in a responsible manner for responsible purposes. The first of these is that activity should be focused exclusively on public pages, rather than seeking to ‘hack’ protected areas of sites. The second is to respect the contents of the ‘robots.txt’ file used by webmasters to indicate the areas of sites that are open for indexing by search engines and those that are closed (expressed through “nofollow” tags). The third factor relates to ensuring that the purpose of the activity is both legal and legitimate. For example, obtaining factual information from web pages constitutes a legitimate and legal use. However, obtaining information on individual persons without their consent would generally not be a legitimate or legal purpose. Finally, many websites contain terms and conditions that should be respected where possible while noting that in the absence of a ‘robots.txt’ it is generally impractical to review terms and conditions for research conducted on a large volume of websites.\nThe Common Crawl expresses these principles in its terms of use. In other circumstances offices for national statistics have developed policies that include the above elements, such as the EU’s current work in progress, WPC ESSnet Webscraping policy draft to guide activities within the European Statistical System (ESS). The authors of the current research adhere to these principles and practices, notably in relation to respecting the ‘robots.txt’, not collecting data outside the scope of the project (such as personal information) and not retaining the raw data.\nWeb scale snapshots from the Common Crawl include the whole panoply of information available on the public internet and will include information that will be racist, offensive or discriminatory. The use of such data to train AI models has been a significant focus of ongoing concern. However, in recognition of these issues, companies within the AI space have also sought to improve the data available for training models by identifying and removing such materials.\nA second factor in the use of internet web snapshots within the AI community is the problem of scale. As noted above the Common Crawl snapshots involve billions of web pages and are hundreds of terabytes in size. This makes its use at scale impractical for many potential users. In response to these issues, in late 2019 a research team at Google released a cleaned up snapshot in the form of the Colossal Crawl C4 dataset. The dataset used a procedure to remove pages containing offensive terms and also sought to remove the vast swathes of duplicate pages and pages consisting purely of code that dominate the Common Crawl snapshots. The Colossal Crawl dataset was used to train the Google T5 series of AI text generation and language translation models (Raffel et al. (2019)). The growing importance of cleaned web scale data to AI as a field has led to increasing efforts to release cleaned up snapshots for wider use.2\nThe growing availability of pre-cleaned web scale snapshot for training Large Language Models also presents opportunities for research teams to access cleaned up datasets for fact based research. We chose to explore the web scale C4 dataset for marine genetic resources as our starting point and as a basis for understanding what the options might be for updating the data in future as new snapshots and new methods become available.",

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nThe C4 dataset is publicly available for download either through the TensorFlow datasets site or through HuggingFace (the main online hub for AI models and datasets) courtesy of work by the Allen Institute for AI and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4. The snapshot is divided by language name and also subdivided by whether the data is clean or raw. To our knowledge, web scale data has not previously been explored for biodiversity and genetic resources and we initially focused our attention on English language web texts in the English clean dataset (“en.clean”).\nThe English clean dataset consists of 364,978,294 million web pages consisting of a url hyperlink for the source page and the text of the page. It is 806 gigabytes in size. The cleaning and deduplication process undertaken by the team at Google radically reduces the size of the data from over 6 terabytes and makes it considerably easier to work with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 66: A View of the C4 open access dataset on the Hugging Face AI hub\nThe identification of marine genetic resources in a dataset of this size can be likened to finding a needle in a haystack. To approach this task our strategy has been to:\n\nBreak the web texts into individual words and phrases removing common stopwords (known as tokenizing);\nIdentify web pages that contain common marine related terms (marine, sea, seas, ocean, oceans and so on);\nUse a dictionary of words and phrases for products (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals etc.) constructed from text mining the International Patent Classification to identify marine web pages that also contain product terms;\nBased on the outcomes to narrow the dataset down to specific areas (e.g. compounds, cosmetics, cosmecueticals, enzymes, krill, pharmaceuticals etc);\nConstruct a ‘fishing net’ dictionary of marine terms (using the work conducted for the scientific and patent data discussed above);\nIdentify product related words in web pages (cosmetic, pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, nutraceutical and so on);\nIdentify marine related terms in the texts containing product terms (co-occurrences) using the marine fishing net. This includes the use of frequency scores for the marine terms to identify highly relevant texts;\nRetrieve the full texts from step 5 where the texts contain both a product and a marine related term;\nUse a machine learning model for named entity recognition on the texts and the identification of products as the basis for further analysis.\n\n\nTokenizing Web Texts\nIn the initial step the 364 million web pages are split into individual words (tokens). Common stop words (e.g. ‘and’, ‘or’ etc.) are removed. Processing is performed in Apache Spark which is widely used for memory efficient large scale parallel processing of texts. Apache Spark can be used with common data science programming languages such as Python using pyspark or R using sparklyr. The code below is written in R with the sparklyr package and assumes that a user already has a Spark cluster running.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sparklyr)\n\nc4_en &lt;- spark_read_json(sc, \"c4_tbl\", path = \"en/*\", memory = FALSE)\n\nspark_unigram &lt;- function(df) {\n  \n  df_tok &lt;- df %&gt;%\n    ft_tokenizer(\n      input_col = \"text\",\n      output_col = \"word\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    ft_stop_words_remover(\n      input_col = \"word\",\n      output_col = \"word_clean\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    mutate(word = explode(word_clean)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(nchar = nchar(word)) %&gt;%\n    select(url, word) %&gt;%\n    mutate(ngram = trim(word))\n}\n\nc4_en_words &lt;- spark_unigram(c4_en)\n\nThis process produced a data table with 69,838,178,742 or ~69.8 billion words and the associated urls for each word. The same exercise was performed to identify two word phrases (bigrams) and produced a table with 77,158,645,013 or ~77 billion phrases. It is possible to expand this approach (for example to three word phrases and so on) but this was deemed sufficient for the immediate purpose.\nOne challenge in approaching 69.8 billion words from 354 million web pages is how to narrow the focus to those pages that involve the marine environment and products, and from there, attempting to isolate marine genetic resources from ABNJ. There are two possible options for this. The first is to identify all web pages in the data that mention some kind of product, accompanied perhaps by words such as “checkout”, “shopping basket” and related terms. This first approach would seek to capture all web pages within the C4 dataset that mention some kind of product and from there narrow the focus down to the marine environment and ABNJ. An alternative approach would be to start by narrowing the data to a set of marine terms and then identify product related terms in the web pages that contain the marine terms.\nWhen dealing with data at the level of billions of items one important challenge is data handling. After a period of experimentation with the first approach we opted for the second approach as it was more practical within the project timeline.",

    "section": "A High Level Overview",
    "text": "A High Level Overview\nWe can begin to explore the data in a straightforward way by seeking to count up the number of pages that contain individual words such as ‘marine’. In total we identified 19.6 million occurrences of the selected marine terms in 9,961,171 distinct web pages. The terms in Table 9 are counts of the number of occurrences of terms in the c4 dataset and have been aggregated (e.g. ‘sea’ and its plural ‘seas’ have been aggregated to the singular ‘sea’).\nTable 9: Occurrences of Marine Terms in Web Pages in English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we might expect, the terms ‘sea’ and ‘ocean’ rank top in terms of occurrences with terms like ‘deep sea’ and ‘hydrothermal’ ranking lower. Note here, that some terms can be expressed either as a single term (e.g., ‘deepsea’ or ‘deep-sea’) or as a two-word phrase (‘deep sea’). We focus here purely on single terms. In other cases, such as ‘hydrothermal’, the term will cover the full spectrum of uses of a term (e.g. ‘hydrothermal energy’ and ‘hydrothermal vents’) rather than being confined to a marine use.\nWe can gain an insight into the uses of these terms in websites by counting up the main or base domains for the sites as set out in Table 10.\nTable 10: Counts of Web Pages for a Selection of Marine Terms for English Websites (top 10 only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we see here is therefore, for websites in English, the full spectrum of sites that address the marine environment of which ABNJ is a part. At the top level we see encyclopaedia sites such as Wikipedia, journals such as PLOS One, a US community marketing site (agreatertown.com), an information site for the US military, trade sites for sales of yachts and boats (www.tradeonlytoday.com), newspapers such as the LA Times (latimes.com) and yachting and nautical map sites (such as geogarage and gpsnauticalcharts.com). In short, analysis of this type, while currently confined to English sites, allows us to gain a sense of the full spectrum of human uses of marine and ABNJ related language.\nThe increasing ability to conduct analysis at this level has important implications for understanding human relationships and perceptions of the marine environment and ABNJ and to evaluate public awareness of international policy measures and their effectiveness. On a wider level, the ability to conduct this type of analysis has implications for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the High Seas Treaty. However, there are two important constraints to conducting analysis at this kind of scale, and across multiple languages. The first of these is computational, in terms of the compute power required. While the issue of compute can be overcome through the allocation of more resources it is here that we encounter a second issue. That is, the ability to extract meaningful information in a timely way to inform policy debates and decision making on topics such as marine genetic resources. It is here, that the increasing opportunities for automation represented by AI could, with appropriate controls and validation, make an important contribution. Data at the level of individual words is useful for gaining a sense of the overall scale of human attention to the marine environment and ABNJ. Breaking texts down into individual words and the ability to assess those words mathematically in the contexts of the company those words keep, to borrow from Raymond Williams, is the foundation for Large Language Models in AI. However, analysis using individual phrases can assist with targeting analysis and navigating the sea of texts on the marine environment produced in human societies. For the present project we now narrow the focus to the exploration of phrases rather than the use of individual words. However, we return to words below, in the context of AI assisted approaches to interrogating web scale data.\n\nProduct Related Terms\nHaving gained an insight into the appearance of marine related terms in the web data the next step is to identify web pages that contain references to products. To do this we use a dictionary of 1,264 product terms derived from text mining the International Patent Classification (IPC). The International Patent Classification is technology focused but also makes extensive reference to a wide range of products (antibiotics, cosmetics, perfumes, nutraceuticals etc.) as part of its organisational logic.\nTable 11 presents the top ranking counts of product related terms by the number of occurrences in the 6,397,346 million distinct web pages containing marine words. That is, approximately 64% of the 9.9 marine related web pages in the C4 dataset also involved a product related term. In total there were 47,972,787 occurrences of product terms.\nTable 11: Counts of Frequency of Product Terms in Marine Pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results, in broad terms, are what we might expect. The product listings include a broad spectrum of products rather than being associated specifically with the marine environment. The prevalence of terms such as ‘food’, ‘oil’ (which may have multiple meanings), ‘fuel’ and so on are to be expected. The high incidence of the terms ‘ship’ and ‘shipping’ is likely to be mainly explained by the appearance of these terms in the terms and conditions of websites in relation to postage of materials with the remainder relating to vessels.\nThe prominence of the words ‘ship’ and ‘shipping’ due to their common use in American English could have a distorting effect in the remaining analysis because it will tend to rank first. We therefore filter the analysis to exclude ‘ship’, ‘ships’ and ‘shipping’. This reduces our raw page count to 6,116,178 from 6,397,346\nTable 12 shows the top domains based on the number of pages containing both marine and product terms.\nTable 12: Counts of Domain Names of Marine Web Pages containing Product Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data has reduced the counts and changed the rankings but demonstrates the ubiquity of product related terms in the marine website data.\nIn an effort to get closer to marine genetic resources we can narrow the focus to specific product categories. Based on earlier research we can select the following:\n\ncompounds\ncosmetics\ncosmeceuticals\ndrugs\nenzymes\nkrill\nnutraceuticals\npharmaceuticals\nsupplements\n\nFiltering to specific product areas and removing duplicates reduces the number of pages to 463,205 from 6,116,178. The top domains are set out in Table 13.\nTable 13: Counts of Marine Page Domain Names containing Filtered Product Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis reduced the domain (website) count to 220,284 from 1.5 million and therefore had a radical impact. However, the data continues to be dominated by sites such as the now defunct urbanhotlist.com, large sites such as Wikipedia, tourism sites, journals such as MDPI as the home of the Marine Drugs journal, a gambling site, major online news sites, google patents and a range of journals and other sites including music sites.\nAn important insight from this exploratory work is that we had originally anticipated that it would be possible to filter the data to commercial .com or .co and similar domain names. However, many of the domains we see in this list, including newspaper and some journal sites are of the .com type making this measure of limited utility.\nIn response to this we turned to text mining and the use of machine learning models to try and extract clearer information on product related activity.\n\n\nA Marine Fishing Net\nThe outcome of the filtering process outlined above was a reduced set of 463,205 pages containing the marine terms and the product terms. In the next step, bearing in mind the noisy nature of this data as seen in the domain names above, we take the texts as is and split them into individual sentences. The aim of this process is a detailed analysis of the occurrence of terms in a ‘marine fishing net’ consisting of 176,496 marine taxonomic, common names and underwater place names that can be used to identify marine genetic resources as summarised in Table 14.\nTable 14: Marine Organisms in OBIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fishing net was constructed in such a way that it can be used to capture individual words and two word phrases and, on that basis to be extended to capture longer phrases (tri-grams etc).\nSplitting the data into sentences resulted in a total of 64,634,994 sentences from the 463,205 texts. In the next step we split each sentence into individual words and phrases. For example, for two word phrases there were just over 1 billion phrases (1,057,079,385). We then matched words (unigrams) and two word phrases (bigrams) against the marine fishing net of taxonomic, common names and place name terms.\nThe objective of this exercise was to identify sentences in the marine products texts that could be linked directly to a marine organism either through a taxonomic name or common name. We decided to focus specifically on the 2,033,247 sentences from 331,525 web pages that contained an ABNJ taxonomic name or a common name listed in OBIS in order to narrow the focus. Table 15 displays the top ranking terms across common names and taxonomic names in the product related pages based on frequency.\nTable 15: Top Terms in Marine Product Pages by Page Count\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see clearly in Table 15 counts by terms will commonly be dominated by single words. As we might expect Table 15 reveals that the word fish is dominant by a considerable margin. This is followed by references to salmon, krill, whales, rays, seaweed, sharks and shrimp, cod and corals (note that terms have not been aggregated in this figure to merge their plural and singular forms which will affect the rankings).\nA more precise view begins to emerge when we focus on the common names of marine organisms involving phrases. Table 16 displays the top ranking common name phrases of approximately 2,527 common names in the data.\nTable 16: Counts of Marine Organisms in Product Pages by Common Name (Phrases)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis begins to reveal some of the more charismatic marine species, notably marine mammals such as sea turtles, whales, polar bears as well as other organisms including algae, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and further down the list, crabs, whale sharks and other sharks, sponges, fish eggs and soft corals among others.\nIn terms of taxonomic names, we identified 1,224 taxonomic names in the ‘ABNJ only’ working dataset in the product category areas. The highest frequency was for krill (Euphausia superba), the Ocean Sunfish (Mola mola), the Norway Lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), the copepod (Calanus finmarchicus) and Crown of Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), the marine bryozoan (Bugula neritina), the Spiny Mudlark (Brissopsis lyrifera), the Boring Sponge (Cliona celata), the Brittle Star (Amphiura filiformis) and Blow lugworm (Arenicola marina), as shown in Table 17.\nTable 17: Counts of Marine Organisms in Product Pages by Taxonomic Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounts of the frequency of occurrence of species in web pages linked to products give us an idea of the intensity of attention to a particular organism. However, when dealing with commercial web activity we also need to be aware of a practice known as ‘keyword stuffing’ or ‘keyword spamming’ where the metadata of a page is crammed with specific keywords in an attempt to secure a higher page ranking in a search engine.3 For the wider marine dataset, this type of practice could explain the high rankings of sites such as the urban hotlist and the appearance of gambling sites. We therefore focus on page counts.\n\n\nABNJ Organisms and Product Pages\nFigure 67 below displays the top ranking organisms from the working set of ‘ABNJ only’ organisms in the web data ranked on the number of pages. In Figure 67 we also observe counts of product pages linked to the organisms, the domains where the product related pages are published and finally the address (url) for the web page itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 67: ABNJ Species and Products in Web Page Texts\nFigure 67 reveals that overall, on taxonomic names, the data is dominated by krill (Euphausia superba). As we might expect, references to products are dominated by the common name krill followed by krill oil. In terms of domains where pages are hosted we can observe the dominance of academic and research sites as well as occasional commercial sites such as aquacave.com and bodykind.com which advertise sales of krill oil. The second ranked organism is the copepod Calanus finmarchicus which appears in connection with products such as Arctic Ruby Oil and fish feed. As this suggests, we are able to begin to explore the details of references to actual or potential products linked to organisms in ABNJ.\nThe Habitats & Features panel in the dashboard presented in static form in Figure 68 allows for the exploration of specific habitats and features recorded in web pages such as for hydrothermal vents. These references are almost entirely from research organisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 68: Counts of Pages Referencing Hydrothermal Vents and Products\nThe dashboard on named underwater places seeks to capture the named locations in texts containing an ABNJ recorded species and references to products and is provided in static form in Figure 69.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 69: Counts of Pages Referencing Hydrothermal Vents and Products\nFigure 69 makes clear that the top named location for species in our working ‘ABNJ only’ list is in fact inside national jurisdiction in the form of the Great Barrier Reef followed by the East Pacific Rise. In terms of domains and web pages the data is dominated by research institutions.",

We sought to establish evidence for research on or sales of commercial products arising from ABNJ associated species in web pages in the C4 web dataset.\nTable 18 displays a selection of patent applicants and species names. Note that in many cases the ABNJ associated species name appears in the description section of patent documents and in a smaller number of cases appears in the claims section.\nTable 18: Patent Applicants ABNJ recorded species in claims and filings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 19 presents a summary of the top species appearing in the patent documents.\nTable 19: ABNJ associated species in patent documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now test whether there is evidence of company sales of products arising from these organisms on company websites in the patent data.\nTo do that we adopted a multi step procedure:\nWe used an AI assisted ‘patent company to domain name matcher’ to identify the likely official domain names of the patent applicants.

    "section": "AI Assisted Web Research",
    "text": "AI Assisted Web Research\nIn the analysis presented above we have presented the first known exploration of a web snapshot for marine biodiversity and commercial products linked to marine biodiversity. The increasing availability of open access web snapshots opens up opportunities to map out the presence of the marine environment on the public internet and to explore topics such as commercial products linked to marine organisms and ABNJ. Because web snapshots are clearly defined and time bound they provide important opportunities for methodological development that can be validated and improved over time.\nA limitation of web snapshots as a data source is that the decisions made by the creators of snapshots may not always be entirely transparent or properly documented and their scale can make them challenging to handle. For the present research the C4 dataset has the limitation of a cut off point somewhere in mid-2019 but has the significant advantage of retaining the url for each page. In contrast, the more recent MADLAD snapshot from the Allen Institute for AI has the advantage of being more recent but does not retain the urls as identifiers thus limiting its utility.\nHowever, looking forward, an important feature of Large Language Models (such as the Google T5 series) is that they are trained on web snapshots such as C4 or segments of such snapshots. As we have seen above, a web snapshot will typically include a wide range of sites including Wikipedia, news websites, journal sites and a host of other public internet sites. The instructions, or ‘prompts’ for these models can be rendered more precise to answer targeted questions and/or they can be ‘fine tuned’ to accurately answer specific types of question (based on known question answer pairs). In short, the emergence of AI tools opens up new opportunities to enhance transparency in relation to the marine environment in general and ABNJ in particular.\nOne of the emerging popular uses of AI models is as research assistants, particularly for web based research. Particular excitement in the AI community surrounds the ability for large (and small) AI models to automate accurate summarisation of texts. However, a key concern is the propensity of large language models to invent information or present incorrect or misleading information in a way that is not obvious to the non-expert reader. The propensity of Large Language Models to get things wrong is known as ‘hallucination’ within the AI community and arises in part from the generative nature of the models (which are trained to creatively generate texts). In other words, a strength of these models is also a weakness.\nConsiderable attention has been dedicated to ways to address this problem. One approach is to literally instruct a model not to make information up. A second is to adjust the ‘temperature’ of a model to reduce its creativity. A third approach is to attach a model to a knowledge base (known as Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG) that serves as the exclusive source of truth for a model when generating answers. A fourth and complementary approach is to instruct a model to always provide the sources for the answers it gives. Combinations of these approaches, which are not mutually exclusive, are proving effective in tasks such as question and answer and summarisation. Ultimately, however, at present in this early stage in the use of AI automation, human review is required for model answers in order to validate AI generated answers.\nA common pattern in research on marine genetic resources is a simple search using Google or a similar search engine. A human researcher then seeks to refine the terms to arrive at a more targeted set of answers and then manually reviews and summarises the results including the sources of the information in the research output. In practice, these common human research activities can be readily automated by creating a so-called ‘research agent’. The creation of research agents as a form of ‘research assistant’ is now becoming popular, a number of companies offer these services, and a range of tutorials are available online.\nThe creation of a research agent to work with the web involves a number of different services and steps. In brief, this involves:\n\nDefining a set of queries (such as taxonomic names or compound names);\nSigning up for services that allow for automated querying and retrieval of data from search engines (for example using Google cloud API services);\nSigning up for an API key to access AI models programmatically (e.g. from OpenAI, Anthropic or a range of other companies) or the more advanced use of a locally hosted AI model;\nA set of instructions (a prompt) for the model to perform when retrieving web results e.g. summarising with a particular aim;\nA separate set of more detailed instructions for the model to perform when analysing the web results (such as extracting taxonomic and common names, summarising information on ecology and geographic distribution, or products that contain components of an organism) and the format for the output;\nWhen working with web data at scale an Application Programming Interface programme (e.g. FastAPI) or similar is required\n\nFinally, at the time of writing, the creation of a research agent requires programming knowledge but paid services such as those from OpenAI allow for the creation of types of research agent. As such, we anticipate that the use of these research agents will become more widespread as AI services expand and mature.\n\nIdentifying Commercial Products\nWe used a research agent as part of an exercise in identifying commercial products linked to species recorded in ABNJ. We chose to use the working set of 7,982 ‘ABNJ only’ taxonomic names for the test and ranked them on the number of occurrences. The working assumption behind this approach was that species recorded in ABNJ at higher frequency are more likely to have been a focus of commercial research and development than low frequency species. Table 21 shows the top ranked organisms.\nTable 21: Working Set of ABNJ Only Organisms ranked by occurrence records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then set the AI research agent the task of iterating over the first 1000 ranked organism names (including genus and above where relevant) to search for and identify whether a commercial product linked to the organism could be identified.\nIt transpires that defining what is, or is not, a commercial product is not as straightforward as it at first appears. At first sight, we can assume that a commercial product is a product that is sold on the market that is based on or contains elements of the organism of interest. However, how is an AI model to know what those elements are? In response to this we included the following draft definition in its instructions.\n\n“You will recognise that commercial products include enzymes, luciferases, biotechnology, chemical compounds, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, medicines, nutraceuticals, supplements, fisheries, foods and other products that are sold for profit”\n\nAs this makes clear, what is understood by a commercial product, could mean quite a number of things that could be articulated in different ways. Success in instructing a model depends on finding formulations that a model can understand when analysing material. For example, the use of the term biotechnology in the above instruction could be considered ambiguous.\nA second issue in instructing a model involves a category that we might characterise as ‘potential’ products. In this category are compounds and other parts of an organism that are a focus of research for potential applications but are not as such marketed products. In an attempt to capture these potential products we included the following instruction.\n\n“If you are asked to search for commercial products you know that some commercial products are potential products such as potential treatments for cancer or diabetes. You should include these even if there is no price.”\n\nIn an attempt to reinforce the importance of potential products we also included a shortened version of this instruction in the initial instruction for scraping and summarisation prior to analysis.\nAn additional objective was to obtain information on the prices of products on the market. Once again, while this could be considered to be straightforward it is in reality ambiguous when seen from the perspective of a Large Language Model. Given the possibility of multiple markets and multiple products, the behaviour of the model was to give an ambiguous answer.\nThe results are summarised in Table 22 focusing on organisms where the web search and summary suggested the existence of some form of actual or potential commercial product.\nTable 22: ABNJ Only Organisms AI Agent Associates with Commercial Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model was asked to write a general summary for all of the species and also to ensure it provided references for all sources. The model was also asked to provide specific details of commercial products in cases where actual or potential commercial products could be identified. The results of this exercise are available in the Annex.\nOf a total of 970 of the top occurring species names in our working dataset, a total of 839 (86%) were not associated with actual or potential commercial products and 129 (13%) of the total were associated with some form of commercial product.\nTable 23 shows an example of a research summary for the Patagonian toothfish.\nTable 23: Example of an ABNJ Only Species Associated with Commercial Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the generation of summaries, the model is also capable of providing details on commercial products. Table 24 shows an example of the details of commercial products for the Patagonian toothfish.\nTable 24: Example of Species Associated with Commercial Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is here however, that the nature of commercial products become relevant. At first sight, the majority of commercial uses referred to the use of an organism in commercial fisheries or in sports fishing rather than uses of a marine genetic resources as such. However, more detailed analysis of the results reveals a more complex picture involving a wider variety of uses.",

    "section": "Product Searches on Amazon",
    "text": "Product Searches on Amazon\nPatent documents give us an insight into the potential commercial uses of a biological organism, along with an indication of intent to commercialise such uses. The scale of patent activity can also be a useful indicator of the scale of commercial interest. However, while patent activity provides a perspective on commercial intent, patent activity only provides a limited insight into the commercial availability of products containing compounds from biological organisms. That is, patent activity cannot tell us definitively what actually makes it to market.\nIn order to bridge this gap, we sought to assess the extent to which we can determine the commercial availability of products containing compounds from marine organisms on the internet. We conducted an experiment using publicly available data from amazon.com, accessed via Rainforest API. An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs specify how software components should interact, enabling the sharing of data and functionalities across various applications. In the context of our work, the use of Rainforest API allowed us to collect results from Amazon web searches at scale, where otherwise searches might have to be completed manually one at a time.\nThe use of the amazon.com domain restricted results only to those which appear to consumers based in the United States and US territories like Puerto Rico. Along with amazon.com, it is possible to access 21 other domains using Rainforest API, from countries including Germany, India and Saudi Arabia. Limiting our experiment to the amazon.com domain was done in the interest of reducing time and cost. The products shown on amazon.com may be available to consumers from other regions, however, this often depends on the shipping choices of individual sellers. As such, the data presented must be seen as a scoping exercise, rather than a comprehensive overview of global market availability.\nAs this data is collected by creating searches on amazon.com, the API does not perform in the way that a traditional API might. Traditional APIs allow users to set clear parameters relating to what they expect to receive in their return, however, since this is not a typical API, it displays some unique characteristics. This can present challenges when attempting an information gathering exercise like the one attempted here, because it may mean that Amazon shows results which may not be directly relevant to the search term used. Many species names are not typical of the types of searches often conducted on Amazon. As a result, these may be considered as spelling mistakes to be corrected. It is possible to turn off spelling mistake correction in calls to the API, however, the issue of ‘fuzzy matching’ appears to be something that cannot be handled through the API. In cases where no direct matches are found for a search query, it may make business sense for Amazon to show users listings which match partially or vaguely on the search term. For example, searches for “eukrohnia hamata” produced results for ham products.\nA further issue encountered was the apparent use of AI to generate product listings, this led to prints, and t-shirts containing images of obscure marine species to appear commonly in the listings. The challenge thus becomes how to filter through irrelevant listings to find listings in which products containing a marine organism may be being sold.\nWithin the current scope of our work, it would not be possible to search for any components or ingredients frequently known to originate from marine species. It is also commonly possible for such components to be obtainable from several different species. For our purposes, we restricted ourselves to attempting to find listings where either the species name or common name were found within the title, keywords, feature bullets and description of each listing.\nWe passed 4,000 marine taxonomic names to the Amazon API. Amazon listings were returned which matched in some way (as defined by Amazon) to our search terms. 31,864 listings were returned. This initial return contained information relating to title and price, information which may be seen on a “results” page when entering a search term. Table 25 below shows a preview of the original return. This initial return did not contain detailed information from the product page itself. In order to get more detailed information about a listing, the ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) must be passed along to the API again, this creates a return which includes the product description and key words, allowing us more insight into the product, its usage and any relevance to marine organisms.\nTable 25: Amazon Original search results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of listings were irrelevant to our purposes. We first removed listings from our original return where stop words were present in the title. Stop words are words that, when present, indicate that it is highly unlikely that the listing is relevant to our present purposes. For example, the presence of words such as “book”, “microphone” or “sofa” in the title of the listing strongly suggest that the product referred to does not contain organic compounds. Table 26 is an example of the type of irrelevant listings that come through. After parsing our listings for stop words, 9,435 listings remained. These listings were returned as results relating to 1,817 of our original 4,000 species, though it was clear that many listings present still were not relevant. After the removal of duplicates, the remaining ASINS were then sent off through the Amazon API. 4,361 listings were returned. These were then joined onto our original listings.\nTable 26: Examples of Junk Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, we had a table with the listing data and the search term (in most cases this was the taxonomic species name, in some cases this was the genus name or the common name). To improve thoroughness, and screen for cases in which a species was referred to in whole or in part by common name, but not by taxonomic name, we joined the table with a list of common names obtained from OBIS.\nIn order to find listings which matched at least one of our names, we filtered the listings to results which contained at least one word from the search term or common name. This likely included many results which still were not relevant. For example, search results for the species Radiella antarctica and Solanometra antarctica included lapel pins in the shape of Antarctica. This did however, allow us to exclude any listings which were categorically irrelevant. This resulted in 1,713 listings.\nDue to the persistence of noise and junk at this level, results were then reduced further to only listings which contained either the full search term, or the full common name. This reduced results further still to 404 listings. Needless to say that from a starting point of 4,000 species names, this was not many. The species for which the most relevant results were found were mostly widely available species, which could be easily be collected from inside or outside EEZ.\nSeveral listings were found for canned tuna species including skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). Sea sponge species were found for sale for homeopathic purposes, including the use of roasted sea sponge for coughs, croup and breathing difficulties. Calcareous sponges were also found for sale for use in homeopathy, for the treatment of sprains, growing pains and acne. The roe of Cheilopogon heterurus, a species of flying fish, was also sold.\nIn the final return, we found 66 listings referring to krill species mostly Euphausia superba. Krill was marketed in the form of krill oil as a source of Omega-3 fatty acids for human consumption, and in some cases directly marketed towards women, with multiple health benefits ascribed to it. Listings also referred to the use of freeze dried krill as fish feed. Table 27 shows the final results for krill species.\nTable 27: Final results for krill species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found 28 listings for products related to sea cucumber species. These listings referred to sea cucumber extract, sea cucumber essence, or whole sea cucumber marketed for wellness benefits. Table 28 shows the final results for sea cucumber species.\nTable 28: Final results for sea cucumber species (sample)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found 14 listings for products related to species from the genus Calanus, a genus of marine copepods. Calanus oil appears most frequently as a source of Omega-3 fatty acids, marketed for human consumption for health benefits. Freeze dried calanus species were also found for sale for use as fish feed. Table 29 shows the results for calanus species.\nTable 29: Final results for calanus species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 70 is a map of Calanus finmarchicus distribution courtesy of GBIF which shows that, while the species is most densely found within ABNJ, it is also found within the EEZ of several countries. This is also the case for many of the other widely distributed species for which results were found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 70: Distribution of calanus finmarchicus from GBIF\nIt does not seem that any species unique to ABNJ are apparent in the listings. If they are available on Amazon, they are not mentioned directly by name. This is not to say that products containing species unique to ABNJ are not available, but rather that they were not found in this search. It is also possible that products containing species unique to ABNJ are not available on Amazon, or that they are not available for sale at all.",

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this section we have explored the appearance of marine genetic resources from ABNJ in hundreds of millions of web pages. To our knowledge this is the first time that this has been attempted. The growing availability of web scale data from the Common Crawl as part of the emergence of Large Language Models in Artificial Intelligence provides important opportunities to identify marine genetic resources at scale. As we have seen, this also offers opportunities to map and explore the multiple ways in which people interact with and value the marine environment.\nAnalysis of web data at this kind of scale is very challenging and AI tools which are trained using web scale data are well suited to supporting analysis of web activity. We engaged in an experiment with creating an online research agent that would access, assess and summarize relevant web pages. This experiment revealed that AI tools can be used to automate searching and summarizing information on marine organisms and can potentially be used for many thousands of species. However, a key limitation of automation using AI is data validation, that is: how do we know that the results returned by an AI model are true? This is an issue that is confronting many AI developers and will find an answer in approaches such as requiring written evidence, cross-validation of results using other models and human review of samples of the results. We should anticipate significant advances in quality control methods in future years. For the BBNJ treaty the use of AI offers opportunities to automate tasks such as researching the use of marine organisms, public awareness of the marine environment and the BBNJ Treaty, and automation of retrieval of information linked to the BBNJ Batch Identifier. In other words, AI promises to improve the ability to automate research and reporting tasks at scale.\nAn important limitation of web scale data and snapshots such as C4 relates to the technologies that are used to generate web pages. Thus, the reason that much of the content of the Common Crawl consists of pages of code rather than text is that many web pages are generated ‘on the fly’ when a visitor arrives at a site rather than existing as static html text. This is significant for research on the commercial use of marine genetic resources because it means that web snapshots such as C4 will be limited to those sites containing static, rather than dynamic, pages. As commercial sites are more likely to use dynamically generated pages the use of snapshots will be biased towards static sites such as news sites and university web pages. Recognition of this issue is an important outcome of the present research in using web scale snapshots. However, the use of automated research agents, which actively visit sites, could assist with overcoming this problem in future (subject to the terms and conditions of the sites visited). As such, it is important to be aware of both the limitations and opportunities for web scale research in the era of AI.\nIn a second independent experiment we explored the use of commercial AI and API services to automate search and summary of Amazon product listings. This experiment revealed that more widely known species such as krill will yield informative results. However, the efforts of commercial sites to always show the customer a results can confound efforts to identify activity for lesser known organisms by flooding the raw results with noise that is very difficult to control. Nevertheless, the promise of this approach is that it may be possible to gain an insight into the emergence of commercial products involving organisms from BBNJ.\nThe results presented in this section should therefore be seen as an initial experiment in exploring the possibilities of web scale research using AI for the automation of searches and reporting to support implementation of the BBNJ Treaty. We anticipate that these types of approaches, with due regard to the limitations and the need for appropriate controls, will become increasingly useful in informing policy decision-making in future years.",

However, the dataset does not contain the url for the web-based texts which limits its utility for our purposes. The full dataset is also 7 terabytes in size.↩︎\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) is a widespread practice and increasingly uses AI in order to bump up the presence of a page to the top of search results with search engines such as Google or Bing. Search engines now automatically penalise well known practices such as keyword stuffing. However, this does not mean that people will not attempt it or similar practices.↩︎\nPatent applicants are simultaneously noisy, in that they may be expressed in a variety of forms, and dynamic. The use of an AI assisted ‘company to domain name matcher’ revealed that a significant number of companies do not have an obvious public site on the web, have been acquired by other companies or have gone out of business. Traces of these companies were typically found in business news websites and listings. We did not pursue those names further.↩︎",
